# GOVERNANCE MODEL — LOGOS SYSTEM

## Status
Design-only. Non-executing. Non-authoritative.
This document defines governance constraints, not runtime behavior.

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **governance posture, authority boundaries, and safety invariants**
that constrain the LOGOS System across all simulations, tests, and design phases.

Governance governs:
- what *may* execute
- who *may* act
- how *authority is constrained*
- when the system *must fail closed*

Governance does **not** execute code.

---

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Deny-by-Default

No capability, authority, or continuation is permitted unless:
- explicitly authorized
- properly gated
- provably admissible

Implicit authority is forbidden.

---

### 2. Runtime Sovereignty Is Scoped

- `Logos_Agent` is **runtime-sovereign**
- Sovereignty applies **only within runtime execution**
- Evolution, deployment, and persistence remain **human-gated**

Runtime sovereignty ≠ autonomy over governance.

---

### 3. Explicit Authority Chains Only

All authority must flow through explicit, auditable chains:

Governance  
→ STARTUP / PXL_Gate  
→ Logos_Protocol  
→ Logos_Agent  
→ Subordinate Agents (proposal-only)

No component may escalate its own authority.

---

### 4. Separation of Governance and Observation

**System Operations Protocol (SOP)** is strictly observational.

SOP:
- records telemetry
- tracks health and performance
- logs operational metrics

SOP:
- does NOT enforce governance
- does NOT influence execution
- does NOT block or permit actions

Governance enforcement occurs through:
- STARTUP gates
- Logos_Protocol mediation
- Logos_Agent decisions

---

### 5. Audit Isolation (Non-Negotiable)

`SYSTEM_AUDIT_LOGS` are:

- append-only
- immutable
- out-of-runtime
- not importable
- not readable by runtime

**No audit readback is ever permitted.**

This invariant prevents:
- state leakage
- recursive contamination
- historical bias in runtime cognition

---

### 6. Fail-Closed Supremacy

If governance artifacts are:
- missing
- malformed
- contradictory
- unverifiable

The system must:
- halt
- deny continuation
- deny execution

Fail-open behavior is forbidden.

---

## Scope of Governance

Governance constrains:
- runtime activation
- memory domain separation
- observability boundaries
- self-modification permissions
- simulation limits

Governance does NOT:
- execute code
- store runtime state
- participate in reasoning
