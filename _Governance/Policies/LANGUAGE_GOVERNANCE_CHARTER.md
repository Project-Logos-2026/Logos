# LANGUAGE GOVERNANCE CHARTER

## Purpose
This charter defines the role of language within the LOGOS system. Language is infrastructure, not cognition.

## Principles
- Meaning precedes language.
- Language renders meaning; it does not generate meaning.
- Language has no dialogic authority.

## Scope (V1)
- Deterministic rendering of SMP-derived meaning.
- No persona, affect, or conversational optimization.

## Authority
This charter supersedes stylistic, UX, or presentation concerns.
