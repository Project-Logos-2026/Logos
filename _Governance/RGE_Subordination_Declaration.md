# RGE Subordination Declaration

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE  
**Scope:** Authority boundaries for the Radial Genesis Engine  
**Authority:** Governance Spine (supreme). Logos Core (sovereign). RGE (subordinate).

---

## 1. Logos Sovereignty

Logos Core is the sovereign authority over task routing, topology enactment, and agent orchestration. RGE operates strictly subordinate to Logos. RGE recommendations are advisory. Logos may accept, reject, or override any RGE output.

---

## 2. Coupling Weights Are Logos-Authored

All coupling weights consumed by RGE are produced by Logos and delivered via the immutable Telemetry_Snapshot. RGE does not compute, derive, infer, or generate coupling weights. RGE reads weights from telemetry. This invariant holds for both Phase A (static weights) and any future Phase B (dynamic weights).

---

## 3. RGE Cannot Derive Weights

RGE does not have access to the constraint taxonomy, the task triad derivation procedure, the MESH commutation engine, or any other weight-producing authority. RGE consumes pre-computed, pre-validated, pre-normalized weights. It does not possess the information or the authority to produce them.

---

## 4. RGE Cannot Override Logos

RGE output is a topology recommendation. It is not a command. Logos enacts routing. Logos may refuse any recommended topology. Logos may override RGE under any condition. There is no mechanism by which RGE can compel Logos to adopt a topology.

---

## 5. Agents May Refuse RGE Directives

Agents (I1, I2, I3) are bound to their protocols by the Phase-G Execution Contract. Their identity bindings, execution permissions, and authority boundaries are governed by the Phase-G and Phase-H contracts, not by RGE. If an RGE-recommended topology conflicts with agent governance, the agent governance prevails. RGE cannot rebind agents. RGE cannot alter protocol assignments. RGE cannot escalate authority.

---

## 6. RGE Is Structurally Subordinate

The authority hierarchy is:

    Governance Spine (supreme, fail-closed)
        Logos Core (sovereign; computes telemetry; enacts routing)
            RGE (subordinate advisor; selects topology snapshot)
                Agents (execute within bound protocols; Logos compels, RGE does not)

No layer inversion is permitted. No authority escalation is permitted. No implicit delegation is permitted. RGE is a deterministic topology advisor operating within a bounded finite configuration space. It is not an autonomous agent. It is not a decision-maker. It is not a governance authority.

---

## 7. Enforcement

Violation of this declaration constitutes a governance breach. Any RGE behavior that attempts to:

- Derive its own weights
- Override Logos routing decisions
- Rebind agent-protocol assignments
- Escalate its authority level
- Modify the governance spine
- Alter the runtime spine

is structurally prohibited and must trigger an immediate halt under fail-closed semantics.
