## Checks
- [PASS/FAIL] Externalization boundary explicit and one-way
- [PASS/FAIL] Required artifacts enforced pre-output
- [PASS/FAIL] NL validated against authoritative artifacts
- [PASS/FAIL] Renderer replaceability guaranteed

## Findings
- Summary of observations
- Any authority leakage or bias detected

## Verdict
Phase 4 is:
- [ ] Closed
- [ ] Requires remediation
