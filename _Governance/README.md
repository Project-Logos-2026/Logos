# Canonical Governance Artifacts

This directory contains binding governance documents that define
the action boundary of the LOGOS system.

These files are:
- non-executable
- non-imported
- non-configurational
- authoritative by declaration

Modifying or bypassing these artifacts constitutes a governance breach.

## Language Governance and Epistemic Grounding

Language is a governed subsystem of LOGOS, not a cognitive authority. Linguistic output is constrained by formal meaning and epistemic invariants. See _Governance/Policies/I1_EPISTEMIC_GROUNDING_SPEC.md and _Governance/Policies/LANGUAGE_GOVERNANCE_CHARTER.md. I₁ defines epistemic preconditions for all reasoning, language, and runtime admissibility.
