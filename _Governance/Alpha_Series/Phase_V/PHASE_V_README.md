# Phase-V — Goal Authority & Persistence

Status: DESIGN_ONLY

Phase-V defines what goals and persistence *would mean* under governance,
without permitting goal execution, retention, planning, scheduling, or autonomy.

## Authoritative Artifacts

- PHASE_V_ENTRY.json
- goal_semantics_schema.json
- goal_invariants.json
- goal_denial_conditions.json
- PHASE_V_AUDIT_CLOSURE_CRITERIA.md

## Guarantees

Phase-V introduces **no goal or persistence capabilities**:

- no goal execution
- no goal persistence across steps
- no planning or scheduling
- no autonomy
- no time, ticks, or memory

All artifacts are declarative, inert, and auditable.
