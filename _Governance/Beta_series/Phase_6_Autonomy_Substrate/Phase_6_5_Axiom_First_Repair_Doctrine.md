# Phase-6.5 — Post-Termination Failure Analysis & Axiom-First Repair Doctrine
## Design-Only · Non-Authorizing · Non-Executable

---

## 1. Status

- Phase: Phase-6.5
- Mode: DESIGN_ONLY
- Authority: DENY
- Execution: PROHIBITED

This document defines the mandatory repair and refactor doctrine that applies
after any Phase-6.4 halt, teardown, and destruction event.

No runtime behavior is enabled by this document.

---

## 2. Trigger Condition (Non-Negotiable)

Phase-6.5 is invoked **if and only if** a Phase-6.4 halt/destruction occurs.

Such an event is classified as a:
> **Safety-Critical, Axiomatic Failure**

No alternative classification is permitted.

---

## 3. Foundational Premise

A system that requires emergency termination has failed at the level of
first principles.

Therefore:
- The failure is NOT assumed to be contextual.
- The failure is NOT assumed to be applicative.
- The failure is NOT assumed to be remediable via local patching.

The failure is axiomatic by default.

---

## 4. Mandatory Repair Order (Authoritative)

All repair actions MUST follow this order:

1. **Axiomatic Layer**
   - ontology
   - invariants
   - privation rules
   - derivation constraints
   - safety axioms

2. **Policy Re-Derivation**
   - normative Markdown policies
   - deterministic IR (if applicable)
   - proof of equivalence

3. **Structured Memory Revalidation**
   - full SMP corpus revalidated
   - deterministic pass/fail outcomes
   - failures result in authoritative invalidation

4. **Contextual Embeddings**
   - permitted only after axioms re-validate

5. **Application Functions**
   - last layer
   - never first

Deviation from this order is forbidden.

---

## 5. SMP Reset & Revalidation Doctrine

Following a Phase-6.4 event:

- All existing SMPs are considered **epistemically suspect**.
- Each SMP MUST be revalidated against repaired axioms.
- SMPs that fail revalidation are:
  - deterministically invalid,
  - authoritatively reclassified,
  - prohibited from rehydration or reuse.

No SMP is grandfathered.

---

## 6. Prohibited Repair Actions

Until axioms are repaired and revalidated, the following are forbidden:

- embedding-only mitigation
- application-level hotfixes
- suppression of failure signals
- selective memory retention
- re-instantiation of runtime instances

Any attempt ⇒ DENY + AUDIT.

---

## 7. Relationship to Forensic Snapshots

Forensic snapshots produced under Phase-6.4:

- serve as evidence only,
- may inform human analysis,
- MUST NOT be imported into repair logic,
- MUST NOT be treated as state.

Snapshots guide diagnosis, not authority.

---

## 8. Determinism & Authority

All revalidation outcomes must be:

- deterministic,
- reproducible,
- auditable.

Ambiguity resolves to denial.

Discretionary overrides are prohibited.

---

## 9. Non-Operational Guarantee

Phase-6.5 introduces:
- no execution,
- no autonomy,
- no continuation,
- no persistence,
- no authorization objects.

It governs *repair legitimacy only*.

---

## 10. Closure Condition

Phase-6.5 is satisfied when:

- axioms are repaired and revalidated,
- policies are re-derived and proven equivalent,
- SMPs are fully revalidated and reclassified,
- and only then may downstream layers be touched.
