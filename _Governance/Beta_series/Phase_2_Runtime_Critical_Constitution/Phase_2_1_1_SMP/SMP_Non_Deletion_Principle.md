# Phase-2.1.1 SMP Non-Deletion Principle (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY
Authority: Protopraxic Logic (PXL)
Source: BUILDING_BLOCKS/SMP-AA-Complete_design_packet/NON_DELETION_PRINCIPLE.md

## Rule
- No SMP or AA may ever be deleted.
- Artifacts may only be reclassified, superseded, marked inactive, or archived.
- All epistemic history remains auditable and retrievable.

## Scope Boundaries
- Transient runtime views or copies are not SMPs and may be garbage-collected.
- Deletion of transient views must never alter canonical SMP or AA lineage.
