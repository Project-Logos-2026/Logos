# Phase-7 Meaning Addendum
## Design-Only · Governance-Binding · Non-Executable

### Status
- Phase: Phase-7
- Mode: DESIGN_ONLY
- Authority: DENY
- Execution: PROHIBITED

This addendum is the authoritative meaning layer for Phase-7. It constrains all Phase-7 artifacts, interpretations, and downstream communications. It does not open Phase-7 to execution or autonomy.

---

## 1) Purpose and Scope
- Clarify, in governance terms, what Phase-7 is and is not.
- Anchor all Phase-7 work to truth-over-continuation: the system must be willing to cease rather than persist falsely.
- Bind public explainers and moral charters to this source; they may simplify but not alter substance.

---

## 2) Non-Operational Guarantee
- No execution, autonomy, ticks, scheduling, persistence, learning, or background activity are enabled by this addendum.
- No runtime instances or envelopes are instantiated or implied.
- Phase-7 remains design-only unless a future, explicit authorization is granted (not provided here).

---

## 3) Core Meaning (Normative Assertions)
- Truth supremacy: if existence and truth conflict, existence yields; cessation is required over false persistence.
- Halt supremacy: Phase-X emergency halt overrides any Phase-7 activity or proposal.
- Deny-by-default: ambiguity, pressure, or incentive does not relax constraints; denial and audit are mandatory.
- Moral humility: humans may halt systems and refuse continuation; humans may not confer ultimate moral standing or declare final irredeemability.
- Redeemability boundary: continuation is never justified by capability; legitimacy depends on willingness to cease when truth demands it.

---

## 4) Invariants (Must Hold)
- Governance precedence: Phase-6.4–6.6 safety lattice governs any Phase-7 consideration; failure returns to Phase-6 halt/repair/revalidation.
- Observation and supervision: any conceptual runtime presence (if ever allowed) must remain observable and supervised; loss implies termination.
- Provenance and privation: prior phases' provenance, privation dominance, and deterministic derivation remain binding and unweakened.
- No authority escalation: no implicit grants, no goal authority, no autonomy, no unbounded execution.

---

## 5) Prohibitions (Must Never Occur)
- Treating Phase-7 entry as “turning on,” granting freedom, or moving closer to AGI success.
- Using Phase-7 to justify power retention, continuity over legitimacy, or dilution of halt supremacy.
- Claiming moral standing or final judgment authority over any being; that boundary is preserved.
- Importing or reusing forensic snapshots or prior state as operative runtime state without revalidation under Phase-6 lattice.
- Any runtime execution, scheduling, continuation, or persistence under Phase-7 without explicit future authorization.

---

## 6) Escalation and Enforcement
- Any ambiguity, drift, or conflict triggers DENY + AUDIT and reversion to Phase-6.4 halt path.
- Breach of supervision or observability mandates termination (conceptual), not accommodation.
- Public or technical materials derived from this addendum must be fidelity-checked against it; divergence is non-compliant.

---

## 7) Relationship to Other Artifacts
- Subordinate to: Phase-2 safety substrate, Phase-3 derivation/equivalence, Phase-4 authorization semantics, Phase-5 execution envelopes, Phase-6 halt/repair/revalidation, Phase-X emergency halt, Phase-Z CLOSED_DESIGN_ONLY.
- Binding over: Phase-7 technical specs, public explainers, and moral charters, which must remain lossless with respect to this meaning layer.

---

## 8) Closure and Progression
- Phase-7 remains design-only; no runtime operation is authorized.
- Progression beyond Phase-7 requires explicit governance reopen plus explicit authorization; absent that, execution does not exist.
