# Phase-S Audit Closure Criteria

Phase-S may close only when all activation semantics are fully defined
without enabling activation.

Required artifacts:
- activation_invariants.json
- activation_denial_conditions.json
- PHASE_S_README.md (updated to reference all artifacts)

Phase-S must remain DESIGN_ONLY.
Any executable artifact or implied activation authority prevents closure.
