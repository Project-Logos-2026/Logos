# Phase_C — Sealed Placeholder Phase

## Status
This phase is sealed and carries no authority.

## Rationale
No executable or design-authorizing artifacts were ever ratified for this phase.
It is preserved solely for structural completeness and historical traceability.

## Guarantees
- Fail-closed
- No execution or autonomy
- Non-extensible
