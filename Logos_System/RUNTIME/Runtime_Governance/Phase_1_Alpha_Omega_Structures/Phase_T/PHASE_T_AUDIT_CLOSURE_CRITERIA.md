# Phase-T Audit Closure Criteria

Phase-T may close only when temporal semantics are fully defined
while time remains impossible.

Required artifacts:
- temporal_invariants.json
- temporal_denial_conditions.json
- PHASE_T_README.md (updated to reference all artifacts)

Phase-T must remain DESIGN_ONLY.
Any artifact that creates, simulates, or advances time prevents closure.
