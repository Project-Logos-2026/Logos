# Phase_P — Implementation Preparation (Design Only)

## Purpose
Phase_P defines *implementation preparation* and non-executable structural stubs.
It explicitly does not grant execution, activation, autonomy, continuation, or scheduling.

## Authority
- Protopraxic Logic (PXL)
- Mode: DESIGN_ONLY

## Guarantees
- Fail-closed by default
- No runtime effects
- No implicit permissions

## Relationship to Other Phases
- Follows Phase_O (ordering and boundaries)
- Precedes Phase_Q / Phase_R integration layers
- Subordinate to Phase_X halt supremacy
- Does not imply readiness for Phase_Z
