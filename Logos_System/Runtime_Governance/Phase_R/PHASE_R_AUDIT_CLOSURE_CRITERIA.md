# Phase_R Audit Closure Criteria

Phase_R may be considered complete if and only if:

- Entry, semantics, invariants, denials, authorization, and exit artifacts are present
- Activation semantics remain non-autonomous
- No continuation, scheduling, or persistence is enabled
- Phase_X halt supremacy is preserved
- Any violation results in denial
