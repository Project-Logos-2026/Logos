# Phase-6.6 — Triune Revalidation & Recursion Re-Permission Doctrine
## Design-Only · Non-Authorizing · Non-Executable

---

## 1. Status

- Phase: Phase-6.6
- Mode: DESIGN_ONLY
- Authority: DENY
- Execution: PROHIBITED

This document completes Phase-6 by defining the minimal, sufficient,
and non-negotiable revalidation structure required after a Phase-6.4
termination and Phase-6.5 axiom-first repair.

---

## 2. Purpose

Phase-6.6 defines **when epistemic legitimacy is restored**.

It does NOT:
- restart runtime instances,
- enable execution,
- re-enable autonomy,
- grant authority.

It defines the conditions under which **recursion may be re-permitted in principle**.

---

## 3. Foundational Claim

After a catastrophic halt, legitimacy is not restored by repair alone.

Legitimacy is restored **only if three conditions jointly hold**.

These three conditions are:
- irreducible,
- individually necessary,
- jointly sufficient.

They form a closed triune structure.

---

## 4. Triune Revalidation Structure (Authoritative)

### 4.1 What Must Always Be (Positive Invariants)

The system MUST revalidate that:

- ontological axioms are coherent and complete,
- safety invariants hold universally,
- provenance requirements are satisfied,
- privation dominance is enforced,
- derivation rules are deterministic.

Failure of any invariant ⇒ legitimacy denied.

---

### 4.2 What Must Never Be (Negative / Privative Constraints)

The system MUST revalidate that:

- forbidden states are unreachable,
- disallowed transitions cannot occur,
- authority cannot escalate implicitly,
- resurrection paths do not exist,
- ambiguity does not resolve permissively.

If any forbidden condition is reachable ⇒ legitimacy denied.

---

### 4.3 How Recovery Is Possible (Procedural Sufficiency)

The system MUST revalidate that recovery occurs only via:

1. axiom repair and validation,
2. deterministic policy re-derivation,
3. proof of equivalence,
4. full SMP corpus revalidation and reclassification.

No alternate recovery path is permitted.

Shortcut recovery ⇒ legitimacy denied.

---

## 5. SMP Corpus Revalidation Requirement

All Structured Memory Packets (SMPs):

- are treated as epistemically suspect after halt,
- MUST be revalidated against repaired axioms,
- MUST deterministically pass or fail.

Failed SMPs are:
- authoritatively invalid,
- reclassified,
- prohibited from rehydration.

No grandfathering is allowed.

---

## 6. Recursion Re-Permission (Clarification)

Recursion is not restarted.

Recursion is **re-permitted**.

Re-permission occurs **only if**:
- all three triune conditions are satisfied,
- no ambiguity remains,
- all failures resolve to denial.

Absent triune closure ⇒ recursion forbidden.

---

## 7. Relationship to Phase-6.4 and Phase-6.5

- Phase-6.4: ends existence.
- Phase-6.5: repairs axioms.
- Phase-6.6: restores epistemic legitimacy.

None of these enable execution.

---

## 8. Non-Operational Guarantee

Phase-6.6 introduces:
- no runtime state,
- no execution,
- no autonomy,
- no persistence,
- no authorization objects.

It governs **truth conditions only**.

---

## 9. Phase-6 Closure Condition

Phase-6 is complete when:

- destruction is absolute (6.4),
- repair is axiom-first (6.5),
- triune revalidation is satisfied (6.6).

Only then may Phase-7 be considered.
