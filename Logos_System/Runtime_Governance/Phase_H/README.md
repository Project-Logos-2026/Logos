# Phase-H -- Multi-Tick Governance Design (NON-EXECUTABLE)

This directory contains design-only governance artifacts for future multi-tick agent execution.

Nothing in this folder enables multi-tick execution.

Artifacts:
- Multi_Tick_Policy_Schema.json
- Tick_Budget_Contract.json
- Governance_Denial_Spec.json

These documents:
- Define explicit authorization requirements
- Specify bounded execution semantics
- Provide a typed denial surface for audit and testing

Runtime enablement requires a future, explicit phase.
