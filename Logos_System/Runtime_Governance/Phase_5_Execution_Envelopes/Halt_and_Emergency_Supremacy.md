# Halt and Emergency Supremacy (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY — NON-EXECUTABLE — NON-AUTHORIZING
Authority: DENY (default)

## Emergency Halt Supremacy
- Phase-X emergency halt supersedes all envelopes.
- Halt is immediate, unconditional, and non-appealable.
- No rollback, retry, or continuation after halt.

## Audit
- Any halt event (if activation were ever allowed) must produce auditable records (design-only requirement).

Phase-5 remains non-operational; no execution is enabled.
