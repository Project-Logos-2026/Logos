# Phase_K — Historical Phase (Sealed)

## Status
This phase is sealed and preserved for historical continuity.

## Rationale
Phase_K was exited prior to the establishment of the full governance lattice.
Later phases subsume its role. Completing it retroactively would invent intent.

## Guarantees
- No authority
- No execution
- No extension
- Fail-closed

## Relationship
- Superseded by Phase_L and beyond
- Subordinate to Phase_X halt supremacy
