# Phase-6 Readiness Narrative
## Descriptive Only · Non-Authorizing · Design-Only

### Purpose
This document describes what Phase-6 represents in the LOGOS System lifecycle.
It does not open Phase-6, grant authority, or enable execution.

### Definition
Phase-6 is the first phase at which controlled runtime instantiation
*could be proposed* under explicit governance, authorization, and execution
envelopes.

Phase-6 itself does not imply:
- execution
- autonomy
- ticks
- persistence
- learning
- continuation

### Threshold Meaning
Crossing the Phase-6 threshold would mean:
- governance (Phases 1–5) is complete and closed
- authorization semantics exist but no grants are implied
- execution envelopes exist conceptually but are empty by default
- emergency halt (Phase-X) and policy mediation (Phase-Y) remain supreme

Absent explicit authorization, runtime does not exist.

### Global Context
Phase-6 represents a governance-first approach to AGI:
execution is last, revocation is stronger than capability,
and denial is the default state.

### Current Status
Phase-6 is NOT open.
This document is descriptive only.
