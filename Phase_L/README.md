# Phase-L — Controlled Planning Enablement (Design-Only)

This directory defines the **conditions and constraints** under which
planning *could* be enabled in a future phase.

No artifact here enables planning.
No runtime code may reference this directory.

Planning, if ever enabled, remains:
- non-autonomous,
- governance-approved,
- execution-separated,
- externally auditable.
