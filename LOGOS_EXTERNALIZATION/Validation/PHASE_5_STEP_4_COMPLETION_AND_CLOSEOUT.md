# PHASE 5 · STEP 4  
## COMPLETION AND CLOSEOUT DECLARATION

**Artifact Class:** Phase Closeout Declaration  
**Authority Level:** Canonical (Validation)  
**Status:** CLOSED  

### 1. Declaration

Phase 5 · Step 4 is hereby declared **complete and closed**.

The LOGOS Natural Language Externalization compiler is fully available for
runtime consumption and satisfies all governance, validation, and audit
requirements.

### 2. Scope of Completion

This closeout certifies:

- Layer 1 — AXIOM: closed
- Layer 2 — MODIFIER: closed
- Layer 3 — CONTEXTUAL: closed
- Layer 4 — DISCOURSE: closed

All four layers are deterministic, auditable, and non-authoritative.

### 3. Governance Guarantees

The externalization system:

- Introduces no semantic primitives
- Performs no inference
- Mutates no meaning state
- Propagates no upstream control signals
- Preserves monotonic authority decrease

Language is a projection artifact only.

### 4. Phase Transition Authorization

With this closeout:

- Phase 4 responsibilities are fully discharged
- Phase 5 language availability requirements are satisfied
- Runtime orchestration may safely consume the language compiler

No further language-layer approvals are required.

### 5. Final Statement

The LOGOS system now possesses a complete, governed, multi-signal natural
language projection compiler whose output is expressive, constrained, and
provably non-authoritative.

Phase 5 may proceed.
