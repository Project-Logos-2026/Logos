# Meaning Layer - Semantic Primitive Types (Canonical)

This document defines the complete and closed set of Semantic Primitive (SP) types
admitted by the LOGOS Meaning Layer.

These primitives define what exists at the level of meaning, prior to:
- sequencing
- execution
- control flow
- language externalization

This is a design-only governance artifact.

## Canonical Semantic Primitive Set

SP-01 - Assertion
SP-02 - Distinction
SP-03 - Negation
SP-04 - Constraint
SP-05 - Dependency
SP-06 - Evaluation
SP-07 - Uncertainty
SP-08 - Unknown
SP-09 - Commitment
SP-10 - Relation
SP-11 - Scope
SP-12 - Grounding

---

## Invariants (Primitive-Level)

- All primitives are unordered and non-procedural
- No primitive implies execution, intention, or action
- All primitives must be identity-stable (I1-aligned)
- All primitives must admit:
  - PXL formal representation
  - structural / arithmetic shadowing
  - natural language rendering
- No additional primitive types are permitted without reopening Meaning Layer Step One

---

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are not Semantic Primitives and are intentionally excluded:

- action
- intention
- goal
- plan
- step
- process
- execution
- syntax
- language tokens

These belong to later layers.
