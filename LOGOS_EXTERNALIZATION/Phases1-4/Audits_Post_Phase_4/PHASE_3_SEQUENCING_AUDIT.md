# Phase 3 Audit - Sequencing

Status: Audit Report (Design-Only)
Scope: Transformation admissibility and ordering

## Audit Objectives
- Verify all semantic motion is governed
- Confirm no runtime discretion over meaning changes
- Ensure full auditability of every step

## Checks
- [PASS/FAIL] Transformations enumerated and closed
- [PASS/FAIL] Admissibility defined by SSC + invariants only
- [PASS/FAIL] No autonomous sequencing decisions
- [PASS/FAIL] Audit trail sufficient to reconstruct all steps

## Findings
- Summary of observations
- Any sequencing gaps or bypass risks

## Verdict
Phase 3 is:
- [ ] Closed
- [ ] Requires remediation
