# Phase 5 Build Strategy — Hybrid Accelerator (Authoritative)

## Selected Strategy
Option 5: Hybrid Accelerator

## Rationale
This strategy maximizes development speed while preserving:
- governance integrity
- deterministic behavior
- runtime isolation
- auditability

## Core Idea
- LOGOS truth is already complete.
- Phase 5 builds only projection-layer language.
- AI assistants draft inert templates.
- Final authority remains centralized.

## Execution Model
1. Lock template primitives
2. Parallel template drafting by constrained AI assistants
3. Central normalization and approval
4. Registry lock-in

No step permits semantic inference or runtime interaction.
