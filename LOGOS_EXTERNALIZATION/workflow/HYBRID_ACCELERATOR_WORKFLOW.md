# Hybrid Accelerator Workflow

## Phase A — Primitive Lock
- Template primitives are fixed and authoritative.
- Contributors may not invent new primitives.

## Phase B — Parallel Drafting
- Multiple AI assistants draft templates independently.
- Each template must:
  - map to exactly one primitive
  - declare required slots
  - avoid freeform language

## Phase C — Arbiter Normalization
- Central reviewer (LOGOS integrator) accepts or rejects drafts.
- Accepted drafts are normalized to registry schema.

## Phase D — Registry Lock
- Approved templates are added to TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.md.
- Once locked, templates are immutable.

At no point does drafting affect LOGOS meaning or runtime.
