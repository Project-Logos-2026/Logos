# LOGOS_HUMAN_AUTHORIZATION_DOCTRINE_v1.0

Status: DESIGN-ONLY (NOT ENACTED)

This doctrine defines who would bear moral, legal, and operational
responsibility if LOGOS were ever permitted to act.

This document does not authorize execution.

Execution may occur only if:
- explicit human intent is recorded,
- scope is narrowly bounded,
- revocation authority is absolute,
- liability is accepted,
- auditability is guaranteed.

Until enacted, the governance freeze remains absolute.
