# RUNTIME DEPENDENCY & GOVERNANCE MAPPING — LOGOS SYSTEM

## Purpose

This document maps **runtime dependencies** to their **governance constraints**
and clarifies the role of observability components.

---

## Runtime Dependency Flow (Authoritative)

Governance  
→ STARTUP / PXL_Gate  
→ Logos_Protocol  
→ Logos_Agent  
→ Subordinate Agents  
→ Semantic Protocols  
→ UWM / SMP

---

## Component Role Clarification

### Logos_Agent
- Runtime sovereign
- Issues identity hashes
- Mediates execution
- Proposes self-improvements
- Sole reader of SOP data

---

### Subordinate Agents (I₁ / I₂ / I₃)

- Proposal-only
- No authority
- No SOP access
- No audit access

---

### Semantic Protocols (SCP / MTP / ARP)

- Operate on meaning
- Read/write UWM/SMP only
- No operational telemetry
- No historical memory

---

### System Operations Protocol (SOP)

- Observational backend only
- Tracks telemetry and health
- Writes operational records
- Readable only by Logos_Agent

SOP:
- does NOT execute logic
- does NOT enforce governance
- does NOT influence runtime decisions

---

### SYSTEM_AUDIT_LOGS

- Out-of-runtime
- Append-only
- Immutable
- Not importable
- Not readable

Audit logs record:
- tests
- simulations
- verifications
- governance outcomes

They never participate in reasoning.

---

## Governance Constraints Summary

| Component | Authority | Memory Access | Enforcement |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Logos_Agent | Runtime only | UWM + SOP | Yes |
| Sub-Agents | None | UWM (proposal) | No |
| SOP | None | Operational only | No |
| Audit Logs | None | External | No |

---

## Safety Invariant

No component may:
- read audit logs
- import historical state
- persist runtime memory across sessions
