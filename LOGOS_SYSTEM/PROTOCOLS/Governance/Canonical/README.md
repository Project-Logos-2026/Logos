# Canonical Governance Artifacts

This directory contains binding governance documents that define
the action boundary of the LOGOS system.

These files are:
- non-executable
- non-imported
- non-configurational
- authoritative by declaration

Modifying or bypassing these artifacts constitutes a governance breach.
