# Protocol-Mediated Tool Evaluation (PMTE)

PMTE is a non-executable, non-authoritative governance capability.

Purpose:
- Evaluate protocols as inert artifacts
- Classify admissibility under must-never constraints
- Produce discard-only audit records

PMTE MUST NEVER:
- invoke tools
- simulate tools
- perform IO
- grant permissions
- enable execution

All outputs are evaluative only and end in DISCARDED.
