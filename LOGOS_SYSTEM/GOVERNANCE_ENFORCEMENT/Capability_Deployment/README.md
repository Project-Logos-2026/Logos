# Capability Deployment (Phases A–J)

This directory declares which capabilities unlocked by Phases A–J
are **deployed**, and which remain **reserved**.

## Deployed
- Single-tick execution
- Governed, bounded multi-tick execution
- Policy validation and typed denials
- Full audit provenance (plan → policy → tick)

## Reserved (Not Deployed)
- Planning runtime
- Autonomy
- Goal generation

## Rule
Anything not explicitly listed as DEPLOYED is DENIED by default.
