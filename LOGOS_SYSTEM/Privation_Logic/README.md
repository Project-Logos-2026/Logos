# Privation Logic (Closed)

This directory provides a **runtime-facing pointer** to the
canonical privation logic closure.

## Source of Truth

The authoritative canon lives at:

DEV_RESOURCES/LOGIC_CANON/Privation_Logic_Closure.md

That document:
- Derives privation from the completed MESH global bijection
- Declares privation derivationally CLOSED
- Supersedes legacy incomplete-MESH derivations

## Governance

- This directory contains **no executable logic**
- No axioms are defined here
- Changes must occur only in the canonical source
