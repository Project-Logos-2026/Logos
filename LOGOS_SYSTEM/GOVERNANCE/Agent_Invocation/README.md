# Agent Invocation (Stable, Governed)

This directory defines the **stable external interface** for invoking LOGOS agents.

Agents:
- accept explicit policies,
- execute bounded work,
- emit auditable results.

Agents do not:
- plan,
- choose goals,
- extend authority.

This interface is safe for deployment and integration.
