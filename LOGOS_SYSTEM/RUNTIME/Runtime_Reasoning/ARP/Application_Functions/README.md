# ARP Application Functions (Design-Only)

## Purpose
Provide governed, auditable interfaces for ARP reasoning operations,
replacing embedded prototype logic. These interfaces are prerequisites
for proof projection and attestation.

## Constraints
- Interfaces only (no implementation)
- No new axioms
- No runtime execution
- No authority or autonomy
- Enforceable by Runtime_Control

## Registered Functions
- AF-PXL-VALIDATE
- AF-PXL-CACHE-POLICY
- AF-IEL-DOMAIN-SELECT
- AF-IEL-SYNTHESIZE
- AF-MATH-SIMILARITY
- AF-UNIFIED-AGGREGATE
- AF-EPISTEMIC-DOWNGRADE

## Status
Design-only scaffolding. Implementation not authorized.
