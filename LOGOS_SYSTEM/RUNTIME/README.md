## Privation & Negative Knowledge (Authoritative)

All semantics governing **what must not exist, must not occur, or must not continue**
are defined exclusively in:

- `Privation_Semantics.md` (Phase P₁)

Privation semantics override planning, memory, inference, and continuation.
No agent, planner, or orchestration layer may bypass or reinterpret privation.
