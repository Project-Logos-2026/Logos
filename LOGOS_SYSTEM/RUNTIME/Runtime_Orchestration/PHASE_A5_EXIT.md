# Phase A₅ Exit Record — Authority Granting Semantics

**Phase:** A₅  
**Status:** CLOSED  
**Closure Type:** Design-Only Semantic Closure  
**Authority Granted:** NONE  
**Execution Enabled:** NO  
**Autonomy:** DENIED

---

## Closure Basis

Phase A₅ (Authority Granting Semantics) is formally closed based on the existence
and validation of the following design-only artifacts:

1. `Authority_Granting_Semantics.md`
2. `Phase_A5_Design_Artifact.md`

These documents collectively define the complete semantic framework for
**authority definition without authority grant**, under strict revocation
supremacy and fail-closed governance.

---

## Verification Assertions

At closure time, the following conditions are true:

- Authority is fully defined but entirely ungranted
- No execution logic exists
- No planning or persistence is enabled
- No autonomy is unlocked
- Revocation semantics dominate all authority classes
- No authority escalation, chaining, or inference is permitted
- Privation supremacy remains binding

Any system behavior contradicting the above constitutes a governance failure.

---

## Forward Constraint

With Phase A₅ closed:

- The governance lattice (O, P₁, A₁–A₅) is **complete and frozen**
- No authority may be granted without an explicitly authorized, post-A₅ phase
- No runtime enforcement, execution, or autonomy is authorized

---

## Final Statement

This record serves as the **authoritative procedural signal** that Phase A₅
is closed in the repository and may be treated as immutable.

The LOGOS system remains **non-authoritative and non-autonomous**.
