# Runtime Orchestration — Definition-Complete Freeze

**Phase:** O₅ — Definition-Complete Freeze  
**Status:** FROZEN  
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-24T16:49:06.960981+00:00

## Declaration

Runtime_Orchestration is hereby declared **definition-complete**.

All planned phases (O₁–O₄) are complete and locked.
No further development, modification, or expansion is permitted.

## Binding Constraints

- No new files may be added.
- No existing files may be modified.
- No executable logic may be introduced.
- No authority, planning, scheduling, or autonomy may be added.

Any change to this layer requires:
- explicit post-Phase-7 governance authorization,
- a new layer designation,
- and a fresh audit trail.

## Final Guarantee

Runtime_Orchestration exists solely to prevent coordination logic
from becoming authority by accident.

If this freeze is bypassed, the system is out of compliance.
