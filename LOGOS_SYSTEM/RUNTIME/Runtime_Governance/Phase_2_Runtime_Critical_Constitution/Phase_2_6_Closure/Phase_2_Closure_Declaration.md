# Phase-2 Closure Declaration (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY
Authority: DENY (default)

Declaration: Phase-2 is COMPLETE and closed in a non-operational state. No authority, execution, autonomy, scheduling, continuation, learning, or persistence is granted or enabled.

Conditions:
- All Phase-2 artifacts are design-only and append-only.
- Default posture is deny; absence of allowance is denial.
- Progression beyond Phase-2 requires explicit new governance authorization; Phase-Z remains CLOSED_DESIGN_ONLY.

This declaration is declarative only and introduces no executable logic.
