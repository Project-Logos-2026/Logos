# Authorization Issuance Rules (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY — NON-EXECUTABLE — NON-AUTHORIZING
Authority: DENY (default)

## Issuance (Conceptual Only)
- Issuers must be explicitly designated governance/human authorities; no automated or self-issuance.
- Preconditions: policy mediation satisfied (Phase-Y), proof checks per Phase-3 (IR/Proof frameworks), and privation/deny-by-default constraints respected.
- Mandatory human involvement for any issuance consideration.

## Non-Effect in Phase-4
- Defining issuance rules does NOT grant or imply any authorization in Phase-4.
- No execution, activation, autonomy, or scheduling is enabled.
- Any absence or ambiguity resolves to denial.
