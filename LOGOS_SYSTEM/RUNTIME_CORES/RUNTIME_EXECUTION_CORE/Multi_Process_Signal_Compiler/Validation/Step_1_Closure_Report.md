# Externalization Step 1 — Closure Report

## Scope
This document formally closes **Externalization Step 1 (AXIOM Templates)** and authorizes progression to **Step 2** under the LOGOS Externalization program.

This report is authoritative for Step 1 status and serves as the canonical exit record.

---

## Step 1 Summary

Step 1 established the **AXIOM template layer**, including:

- Atomic externalization primitives
- Slot population and header normalization
- Template manifest alignment
- Registry and schema consistency
- Audit-backed normalization

All Step 1 artifacts are now **canonical, frozen, and read-only** unless explicitly reopened by governance instruction.

---

## Fix-It List Resolution (Authoritative)

The following remediation items were reviewed during Step 1 hardening:

1. **Template type identity collision**
   → Resolved by explicit separation of terminal explanation vs compositional discourse.

2. **Semantic primitive (SP) mapping requirement**
   → Determined to be out of scope for externalization; invalidated as a non-item.

3. **Step terminology leakage**
   → Resolved by deletion of legacy markdown artifacts and enforcement of JSON-only authority.

4. **Orphan / misnamed schema artifacts**
   → Resolved by deletion after architectural disambiguation.

5. **Dual schema authority (Markdown vs JSON)**
   → Resolved; JSON artifacts are sole authority.

6. **Workflow classification ambiguity**
   → Resolved; workflow contains guidance only and is non-authoritative.

All six items are either **resolved or formally invalidated**. No open remediation remains from Step 1.

---

## Validation Outcome

- Internal consistency checks: **PASS**
- Registry / schema alignment: **PASS**
- Template manifest consistency: **PASS**
- Governance constraints satisfied: **PASS**

Step 1 is therefore **closed and frozen**.

---

## Authoritative Guidance Moving Forward

The externalization build plan document under DOCUMENTS is designated as the **authoritative design and execution guide** for all subsequent externalization work, including Step 2 and beyond.

---

## Authorization

Work on **Externalization Step 2** is hereby authorized.

No Step 1 artifact may be modified during Step 2 execution unless explicitly reopened by governance decision.
