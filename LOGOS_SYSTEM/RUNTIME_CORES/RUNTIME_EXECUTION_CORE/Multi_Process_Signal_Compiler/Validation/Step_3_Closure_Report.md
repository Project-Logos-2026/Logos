STEP 3 — CONTEXTUAL LAYER
FORMAL CLOSURE REPORT

Status: CLOSED
Layer: 3 — CONTEXTUAL
Authority: LOGOS Externalization Governance
Pipeline Position: AXIOM → MODIFIER → CONTEXTUAL (THIS REPORT) → DISCOURSE
Effective Closure: This report constitutes the binding closure artifact for Step 3.

1. Scope of Step 3

Step 3 (CONTEXTUAL) governs situational framing of compiled statements without altering semantic truth, sequencing, or authority.

Contextual templates:

Do not introduce new assertions

Do not modify logical content

Do not participate in binding as independent units

Attach only to AXIOM or MODIFIER-applied AXIOM outputs

Operate strictly as projection-layer wrappers

Context is applied after modifiers and before discourse assembly.

2. Completed Artifacts (Authoritative)

The following artifact classes were completed and validated for Step 3:

2.1 Contextual Templates

Contextual templates authored for all enumerated context function categories:

Temporal framing

Epistemic framing

Domain framing

Operational framing

Each template:

Contains a canonical Externalization Header

Declares Template_Type: CONTEXTUAL

Resolves exactly one primitive or modified primitive target

Uses only Slot Registry–defined slots

2.2 Slot Registry (Append-Only Update)

Contextual slots appended to the Slot Registry

No existing slots modified

Slot ordering preserved

Slot naming canonical and case-sensitive

All contextual slots trace to Resolved Output Packet fields

2.3 Binding and Ordering Constraints

Context → Axiom / Modified Axiom attachment rules encoded at schema level

Explicit prohibition on:

Context-to-context attachment

Context attachment to discourse-level constructs

Ordering enforced:

AXIOM → MODIFIER → CONTEXTUAL

2.4 Contextual Template Manifest

Manifest generated as a non-authoritative discovery index

Entries validated against:

Template Manifest Schema

Semantic Lexicon Registry

Slot Registry

One-to-one correspondence between manifest entries and template files

3. Validation Results
3.1 Compile-Time Validation (Per Template)

All contextual templates passed:

Header Schema conformance

Primitive resolution via Semantic Lexicon Registry

Slot resolution against Slot Registry Primitive_Map

Template type resolution via Template Type Registry

Manifest consistency validation

Result: No failures. No exceptions. No warnings.

3.2 Structural Invariants Enforced

The following invariants were verified and locked:

Contextual templates do not alter semantic predicates

Contextual templates do not introduce new primitives

Contextual templates do not change proof status or sequencing state

Contextual application is deterministic

No context stacking beyond compiler-mediated ordering

4. Immutability and Governance Lock

With Step 3 closure:

4.1 Immutable Artifacts

The following are now frozen:

All CONTEXTUAL templates

All contextual slot definitions

Contextual binding and ordering rules

Contextual Template Manifest

4.2 Append-Only Artifacts

Slot Registry remains append-only for future layers (e.g., DISCOURSE)

No contextual slots may be altered or reinterpreted

5. Audit and Terminology Compliance

No development-phase terminology present in:

JSON schemas

Manifests

Template headers

All machine-readable artifacts use runtime-stable language only

Audit trail documented and internally consistent

6. Risk Review (Step 3)
Risk	Status	Mitigation
Context altering truth content	Eliminated	Schema-level prohibition
Context stacking ambiguity	Eliminated	Explicit ordering constraint
Slot drift	Eliminated	Append-only registry policy
Semantic leakage	Eliminated	Projection-only invariant

No residual risks remain for Step 3.

7. Closure Declaration

Step 3 — CONTEXTUAL is formally CLOSED.

All artifacts are validated, governed, immutable, and ready for downstream composition.

This report authorizes progression to:

Step 4 — DISCOURSE (Multi-Statement Assembly)

8. Next Authorized Action

Begin Step 4 governance design (Discourse function enumeration and assembly constraints)

No further work on AXIOM, MODIFIER, or CONTEXTUAL layers is permitted without explicit reauthorization

Closure Integrity Statement:
This report is complete, authoritative, and binding.
No assumptions are unaccounted for.
No artifacts remain in a provisional state.

We are now legitimately one step away from a fully governed multi-signal process compiler.
