# Stack Position — MTP

## Inbound
- I2 Agent (pre-privation gated input)

## Outbound
- I2 Agent (finalized SMP)

## Direct Interfaces
- MTP_Nexus for execution routing
- I2 ingress adapter for SMP handoff

## Downstream Dependencies
- SMP enrichment surfaces (Natural Language, Symbolic Mathematics, Formal Logic)
- Append Artifacts (AA) generated later by other protocols

## Non-Responsibilities
- No direct I/O distribution
- No orchestration beyond SMP construction
