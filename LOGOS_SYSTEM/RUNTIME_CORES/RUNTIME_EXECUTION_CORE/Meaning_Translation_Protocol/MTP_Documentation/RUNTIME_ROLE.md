# Runtime Role — MTP

## Scope
MTP operates as a pre-agent, pre-protocol enrichment engine. It is the
authoritative SMP entry-point during the construction window only.

## Authority Boundaries
- Builds and seals SMPs for non-canonical meaning.
- Provides enrichment surfaces, not conclusions.
- No governance authority beyond schema enforcement.

## Non-Responsibilities
- No reasoning, judgment, or truth assertion.
- No admissibility validation or proof work.
- No canonical promotion or memory persistence.
