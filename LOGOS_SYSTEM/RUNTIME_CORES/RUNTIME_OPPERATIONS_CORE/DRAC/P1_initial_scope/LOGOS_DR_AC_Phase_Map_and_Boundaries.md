# LOGOS DR–AC — Phase 1  
## Phase Map and Responsibility Boundaries

**Status:** Canonical  
**Phase:** Phase 1 — Concept Definition  
**Execution:** Forbidden  
**Scope:** Declarative Only

---

## 1. DR–AC Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Purpose |
|------|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 | Concept Definition | Problem, scope, prohibitions |
| Phase 2 | Design Specification | Architecture, scaffolding, invariants |
| Phase 3 | Prototype Formalization | Module-level formal specs |
| Phase 4 | Formal Realization | Type binding, contracts |
| Phase 5 | Implementation | Controlled code realization |
| Phase 6 | Validation | Stress testing, adversarial checks |

---

## 2. Responsibility Transitions

- Phase 1 → defines *why*
- Phase 2 → defines *what*
- Phase 3 → defines *where*
- Phase 4 → defines *how (formally)*
- Phase 5 → defines *how (concretely)*
- Phase 6 → defines *whether it holds*

## 3. Authority Boundaries by Phase

| Phase | Authority |
|------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Human-only |
| Phase 2 | Human + Design Review |
| Phase 3 | Design Canon |
| Phase 4 | Formal Methods |
| Phase 5 | Controlled Execution |
| Phase 6 | Adversarial Evaluation |

---

## 4. Phase 1 Exit Conditions

Phase 1 is complete when:

- Mission is fixed
- Scope is frozen
- Non-goals are explicit
- Phase transitions are defined

No pipeline stages are defined in Phase 1.
