# LOGOS DR–AC — Phase 1  
## Scope, Non-Goals, and Prohibitions

**Status:** Canonical  
**Phase:** Phase 1 — Concept Definition  
**Execution:** Forbidden  
**Scope:** Declarative Only

---

## 1. In-Scope Responsibilities

DR–AC is responsible for:

- Reconstructing session-local context
- Validating inputs against governance
- Assembling bounded compilation outputs
- Enforcing traceability constraints
- Preventing semantic contamination

---

## 2. Explicit Non-Goals

DR–AC does not:

- Decide meaning
- Evaluate truth
- Learn from outcomes
- Modify user intent
- Persist artifacts autonomously
- Generate novel semantics
- Repair malformed inputs

---

## 3. Hard Prohibitions

The following are categorically forbidden:

- Self-modification
- Unbounded adaptation
- Memory mutation without governance
- Semantic inference
- Implicit fallback behavior
- Partial validation continuation

Violation of these constitutes a design failure.

## 4. Relationship to Other LOGOS Systems

| System | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| MTP | Downstream delivery only |
| Memory / Recall | Read-only input |
| Governance | External authority |
| Planning | Out of scope |
| Reasoning | Out of scope |
| Agents | Out of scope |

## 5. Scope Freeze Declaration

This document freezes DR–AC scope.

Any expansion requires:
- A new phase
- New canonical documentation
- Explicit user authorization
