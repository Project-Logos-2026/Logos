# PHASE 5 — Grounding Rule
**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY  
**Authority:** NONE  
**Execution:** FORBIDDEN  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document extends Phase 4 grounding discipline into Phase 5.

It governs **how Phase 5 artifacts may reference or enable future realization** without violating Phase 4.

---

## 2. Trace vs Derive (Preserved)

Phase 5 inherits Phase 4 grounding discipline:

- **TRACE**  
  - Allowed for referencing Phase 4 artifacts
  - Does not add semantics

- **DERIVE**  
  - Forbidden unless explicitly authorized
  - Never retroactive
  - Never reinterpretive

---

## 3. Authority Inheritance Rules

No Phase 5 artifact may:
- inherit execution authority,
- infer runtime semantics,
- or bind Phase 4 types to implementation.

Authority must be **explicitly granted per component**, not per phase.

---

## 4. Prohibited Actions

Phase 5 artifacts must not:

- reinterpret Phase 4 schemas
- consolidate Phase 4 types
- introduce shadow semantics
- backfill missing structure
- introduce implicit derivation classes

---

## 5. Conditional Derivation Extensions

If Phase 5 introduces new derivation patterns, they must:

- be explicitly declared,
- be non-overlapping with Phase 4,
- be audited independently,
- default to DENY.

---

## 6. Validation Protocol

All Phase 5 artifacts must pass:

1. Traceability audit
2. Authority audit
3. Non-execution verification
4. Boundary integrity check

Failure at any step results in rejection, not revision.

---

## 7. Grounding Closure

Grounding compliance is a **hard gate**.

Non-compliant artifacts may not be integrated, revised, or conditionally accepted.
