# DRAC Phase Contract

DRAC operates strictly in discrete, ordered phases.

Rules:
- Only one phase may be active at a time
- Phases are never re-entered
- Completion is final and immutable
- Phase identity is declarative

DRAC does not validate the *content* of a phase.
It validates only ordering and completion.
