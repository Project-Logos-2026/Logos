# DRAC Assembly Invariants

1. Determinism
   - Same inputs produce identical outputs

2. No Epistemic Authority
   - DRAC does not reason, infer, or evaluate truth

3. Fail-Closed
   - Any violation halts assembly

4. Downstream Ownership
   - Validation, reasoning, and governance are external

5. Immutability
   - Completed phases cannot be modified
