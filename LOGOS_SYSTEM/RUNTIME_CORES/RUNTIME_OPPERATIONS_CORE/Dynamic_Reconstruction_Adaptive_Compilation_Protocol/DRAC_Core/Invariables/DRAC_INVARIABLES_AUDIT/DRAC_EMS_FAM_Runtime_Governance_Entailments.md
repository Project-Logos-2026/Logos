# DRAC–EMS–FAM Runtime Governance & Orchestration Entailments

Authoritative Phase‑2 closure artifact.

Defines governance contracts, runtime spine updates, CSP rebinding,
and SOP↔LOGOS protocol boundary rules required to safely integrate DRAC, EMS, and FAM.

Design‑level only. No execution semantics.
