# LOGOS_GOVERNANCE_FREEZE_v1.0

Status: ENACTED

This document formally freezes the LOGOS governance stack at the
pre-action boundary. No execution, invocation, delegation, or tool use
is authorized beyond this point without explicit human approval.

Frozen Layers:
- PMTE — Protocol-Mediated Tool Evaluation
- IGL — Invocation Governance Layer
- DIL — Delegated Invocation Layer (design only)

Invariant:
Judgment may proceed.
Permission may be theorized.
Action may not occur.

See Human Authorization Doctrine for unfreeze conditions.
