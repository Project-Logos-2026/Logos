# Invocation Governance Layer (IGL)

IGL governs whether protocol invocation is permissible *in principle*.
It does not invoke, schedule, recommend, or authorize execution.

IGL operates only on:
- PMTE classification records
- hypothetical invocation contexts
- active governance constraints

All outputs are discard-only, audit-only, and non-binding.

Any ambiguity results in DENIAL.
