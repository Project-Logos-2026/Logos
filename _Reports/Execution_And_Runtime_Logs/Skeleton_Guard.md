# Runtime Orchestration — Skeleton Guard

This directory defines a **structural skeleton only**.

- Presence of files does NOT imply activation.
- No executable logic may be added.
- No imports with side effects are permitted.
- No scheduling, ticks, persistence, or autonomy is allowed.

Any behavioral addition requires explicit post-Phase-7 governance authorization.

If this layer ever becomes useful for deciding things, it has failed.
