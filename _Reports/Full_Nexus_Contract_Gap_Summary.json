  "summary": [
    "All major protocol Nexuses (MTP, ARP, SCP, SOP, EMP, CSP, I1, I2, I3, Logos_Agent) are present and implement the required contract elements (StandardNexus, tick, register_participant, validate, fail-closed, participant registry, MRE where required).",
    "No dynamic import or sys.path manipulation is present outside DRAC.",
    "No missing or embedded Nexuses detected among the inventoried protocols.",
    "If the expected count is 16, additional formalization or explicit Nexus modules may be required for minor or auxiliary protocols not covered in this audit (e.g., DRAC, agent orchestration, or legacy/experimental protocols).",
    "Recommend cross-checking with governance manifests and protocol registry to confirm if any required Nexus is not yet formalized as a standalone module."
  ],
  "status": "PASS for all inventoried protocols; further review required for full 16/16 coverage."
