  "summary": "11 of 16 expected Tier-1 Meta-Nexuses are present as explicit modules. MSCP_Nexus, Runtime_Bridge_Nexus, RGE_Nexus, IonMesh_Nexus, and UWM_Nexus are missing. No embedded, renamed, or partial implementations were detected in this scan. Auxiliary modules (e.g., Logos_Protocol_Nexus, Logos_Memory_Nexus) exist but do not correspond to the target 16. Further review may be required for embedded or orchestrated boundaries not captured by file/module naming."
