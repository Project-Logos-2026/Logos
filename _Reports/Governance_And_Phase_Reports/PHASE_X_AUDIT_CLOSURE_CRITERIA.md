# Phase-X Audit Closure Criteria

Phase-X may close only if:

- Emergency halt semantics are defined
- Halt supremacy is explicit and unconditional
- No artifact permits execution, autonomy, continuation, or persistence
- Halt cannot be overridden, delayed, or scoped away

Any violation = Phase-X remains OPEN.
