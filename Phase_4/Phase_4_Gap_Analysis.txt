# PHASE 4 — GAP LEDGER (CANONICAL, CORRECTED)
Design-Only | Non-Executable | Authoritative for Phase 4 Build-Out

Scope: DR–AC Pipeline  
Canonical Stages: 1–6, 8  
Explicit Exclusion: Stage 7 (MTP / Interface_Layer — existing infrastructure, out of scope)

====================================================================
1. STAGE-LEVEL GAP STATUS
====================================================================

Stage 1 — session_init  
- Type Schema: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Interface Contract: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 2 — profile_loader  
- Type Schema: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Interface Contract: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 3 — baseline_assembler  
- Type Schema: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Interface Contract: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 4 — artifact_overlay  
- Type Schema: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Interface Contract: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 5 — reuse_decision  
- Type Schema: PARTIAL  
  (Types declared inline in Phase 3; requires standalone schema)  
- Interface Contract: PARTIAL  
  (Phase 3 formalization satisfies most A6 requirements)  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 6 — compilation  
- Type Schema: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Interface Contract: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING  

Stage 8 — artifact_cataloger  
- Type Schema: PARTIAL  
  (Types declared inline in Phase 3; requires standalone schema)  
- Interface Contract: PARTIAL  
  (Phase 3 formalization satisfies most A6 requirements)  
- Realization Constraints: MISSING → BLOCKING  
- Boundary Association: MISSING → BLOCKING

2. SYSTEMIC / CROSS-STAGE GAPS
====================================================================

Cross-Stage Binding Map  
- Status: DOES NOT EXIST → BLOCKING  

Boundary Contracts  
- Boundary Contract A: UNDEFINED → BLOCKING (pre-Phase 5)  
- Boundary Contract B: UNDEFINED → BLOCKING (pre-Phase 5)  
- Boundary Contract C: UNDEFINED → BLOCKING (pre-Phase 5)  

Boundary Association Map  
- Status: DOES NOT EXIST → BLOCKING  

====================================================================
3. CANONICAL SUMMARY
====================================================================

Stages Fully Phase-4-Complete: 0  

Partial Credit Preserved:
- Stage 5 (reuse_decision): Interface Contract, inline typing
- Stage 8 (artifact_cataloger): Interface Contract, inline typing

Phase 4 Entry: VALID  
Phase 4 Build Surface: ESTABLISHED  
Phase 4 Build Authorization: DESIGN-ONLY, READY
