# PHASE 4 — FORMAL REALIZATION / TYPE BINDING  
Blueprint + Checklist (Design-Only, Canonical, Corrected)

Status: DESIGN-ONLY  
Execution: FORBIDDEN  
Authority: Specification Only  
Scope: Phase 4 only — no reinterpretation of Phases 1–3

====================================================================
SECTION A — PHASE 4 BLUEPRINT
====================================================================

## A1. Phase 4 Purpose

Phase 4 exists to eliminate interpretive ambiguity between abstract design
(Phases 1–3) and any future realization.

This phase defines, explicitly and formally:
- What each system component *is*
- How it may be interacted with
- What constraints it must obey
- How it may connect to other components

No behavior, logic, algorithms, or execution semantics are permitted.

---

## A2. Phase 4 Exit Criteria (Success Conditions)

Phase 4 is complete if and only if:

1. Every Phase 3 DR–AC pipeline stage has:
   - A formal Type Schema
   - A formal Interface Contract
   - Explicit Realization Constraints

2. All inter-stage interactions are:
   - Explicit
   - Typed
   - Non-implicit

3. All system boundaries are:
   - Formally declared
   - Mapped to governed components

After Phase 4, no future implementer should need to infer intent.

---

## A3. Canonical Phase 3 Stages (Input Set)

The following stages are canonical Phase 3 DR–AC pipeline stages
and must be fully covered by Phase 4 artifacts:

1. session_init  
2. profile_loader  
3. baseline_assembler  
4. artifact_overlay  
5. reuse_decision  
6. compilation  
8. artifact_cataloger  

### Explicit Exclusion

Stage 7 — MTP / Interface_Layer — is intentionally excluded from Phase 4 scope.

Reason:
- Stage 7 is existing infrastructure
- It is not owned by the DR–AC scaffolding
- It is governed under a separate realization track
- Phase 4 artifacts must not redefine or bind it

This exclusion preserves canonical Phase 3 traceability and audit alignment.

---

## A4. Authoritative Build Order (Lowest Risk / Highest Reward)

Phase 4 work proceeds in this order:

1. Stage-level Type Schemas + Interface Contracts  
2. Cross-Stage Binding Map  
3. Boundary Contracts (A / B / C) + Boundary Association Map  

---

## A5. Stage-Level Type Schemas (Primary Track)

For each canonical stage, define a Type Schema that specifies:
- Identity
- Structural fields
- Required vs optional elements
- Nullability rules
- Carried-forward invariants (Phases 1–2)
- Explicit non-capabilities

Schemas define *what kind of thing* each stage produces or consumes.

---

## A6. Interface Contracts (Coupled to Schemas)

For each stage, define an Interface Contract that specifies:
- Inputs (typed, constrained)
- Outputs (typed, constrained)
- Admissible interactions
- Explicitly forbidden interactions
- Failure descriptions (design-only, non-operational)

---

## A7. Cross-Stage Binding Map (Stabilization Layer)

Define a system-level binding map that specifies:
- Which stage outputs may flow to which next stage
- Required type compatibility
- Explicitly forbidden transitions
- No implicit coupling or hidden handoffs

---

## A8. Boundary Contracts (Global Constraints)

Define three Boundary Contracts:
- Boundary Contract A
- Boundary Contract B
- Boundary Contract C

Each Boundary Contract specifies:
- What may cross the boundary
- What must never cross
- Authority limits
- Persistence limits

Then define a Boundary Association Map:
- Stage → Governing Boundary Contract

---

## A9. Explicit Prohibitions (Phase 4)

Phase 4 must not include:
- Code
- Pseudocode
- Algorithms
- Runtime semantics
- Optimization logic
- Execution ordering

---

## A10. Transition Condition to Phase 5

Phase 5 may not begin until:
- All Phase 4 artifacts exist
- All Phase 4 gaps are closed
- No implicit assumptions remain
