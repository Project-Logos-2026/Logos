# GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT INDEX — LOGOS SYSTEM

## Purpose

This document maps **governance rules to enforcement locations**
without granting authority to observational systems.

It answers:
- where rules are enforced
- who enforces them
- who only records outcomes

---

## Enforcement vs Observation

### Enforcement Layers

Governance rules are enforced by:

1. STARTUP / PXL_Gate  
   - proof admissibility
   - activation gating

2. Logos_Protocol  
   - ordered transitions
   - mediation constraints

3. Logos_Agent  
   - runtime decision authority
   - proposal acceptance or rejection

---

### Observation Layers (Non-Enforcing)

**System Operations Protocol (SOP)**:
- records operational facts
- tracks metrics
- logs telemetry

SOP does **not**:
- block execution
- permit execution
- enforce governance

---

## Enforcement Mapping Table

| Governance Rule | Enforcement Point | Observed By |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Phase admissibility | STARTUP / PXL_Gate | SOP |
| Authority scope | Logos_Protocol | SOP |
| Runtime decisions | Logos_Agent | SOP |
| Fail-closed halt | Logos_Agent | SOP |
| Self-modification gating | Logos_Agent + Human | SOP |
| Audit immutability | External storage | N/A |

---

## Audit Record Handling

- SOP may write audit records
- Logos_Agent may request audit writes
- Runtime may never read audit logs

Audit logs serve **historical accountability only**.

---

## Enforcement Invariant

No system component may both:
- enforce governance **and**
- persist historical state

This invariant preserves safety under recursion.
