# Agent_Resources — Canonical Link (Phase-F-0)

This directory is a **read-only symbolic link** to the canonical ontology and epistemology resources.

Authoritative source:
- Logos_System/System_Stack/Logos_Agents/Agent_Resources

Governance:
- Mutation: FORBIDDEN
- Execution: FORBIDDEN
- Scope: Ontological & Epistemic Grounding Only

Purpose:
- Allow Phase-F rebuild runtime to *consume* canonical ontology
- Preserve exactly one source of truth

This linkage is **temporary** and will be removed when the rebuild
is declared authoritative and the legacy stack is archived.
