Scope: Governance closure criteria

---

## Semantic Synopsis (GPT Handoff)

Defines the formal closure conditions for Phase 5.  
Confirms governance completeness without authorizing execution.

---

## 1. Purpose

Phase 5 closure certifies **governance completeness only**.
It does not imply execution readiness or realization approval.

---

## 2. Deliverable Completeness Checklist

Phase 5 may close only when all are COMPLETE:

1. Scope and Charter  
2. Governance Blueprint  
3. Roadmap  
4. Grounding Rule  
5. Artifact Index  
6. Realization Envelope  
7. Failure and Rollback Constraints  
8. Exit Criteria (this document)

---

## 3. Cross-Artifact Consistency Validation

Required:
- No conflicting authority claims
- No execution semantics
- No Phase 4 reinterpretation
- Uniform deny-by-default posture

Any inconsistency blocks closure.

---

## 4. Governance Audit

An independent audit must confirm:
- Boundary integrity
- Grounding compliance
- Absence of implicit authority
- Fail-closed enforcement

---

## 5. Post-Closure State

After closure, the system is in one of two states:
1. **Dormant Governance State** (default)
2. **Separately Authorized Realization Phase**

Phase 5 closure authorizes **neither**.
