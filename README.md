# LOGOS System

## Status
**Design-First | Constraint-Governed | Simulation-Capable**

The LOGOS System is a constraint-governed analytical framework for evaluating
logical, philosophical, ethical, and alignment questions under explicit
governance, epistemic discipline, and safety boundaries.

LOGOS is not an autonomous agent.
LOGOS does not execute actions.
LOGOS does not possess authority outside this repository.

All capabilities are **descriptive, analytical, or simulated** unless explicitly
authorized by governance artifacts.

## Purpose

The LOGOS System exists to:

- Provide a **coherence-first analytical framework**
- Enable **auditable simulations** of reasoning under constraints
- Support **comparative worldview analysis**
- Stress-test logic, ethics, and governance models
- Preserve explicit boundaries between **analysis, simulation, and execution**

---

## Core Principles

- **Constraint before capability**
- **Governance before autonomy**
- **Evaluation before conclusion**
- **Fail-closed / deny-by-default**
- **Explicit uncertainty over speculative completion**

Internal consistency alone is not treated as sufficient; mapping limits to
reality, values, or empirics must be stated explicitly.
