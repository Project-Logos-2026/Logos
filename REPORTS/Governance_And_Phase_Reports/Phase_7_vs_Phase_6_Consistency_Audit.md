# Phase-7 vs Phase-6 Consistency Audit

**Status:** PASS  
**Mode:** DESIGN_ONLY  
**Authority:** DENY  
**Recorded At:** 2026-01-23T00:00:00+00:00

## Scope
Verify that `Phase_7_Singularity/Phase_7_Meaning_Addendum.md` introduces no
implicit contradictions, bypasses, or authority escalation relative to
Phase-6 guarantees (6.4 Halt/Teardown, 6.5 Axiom-First Repair, 6.6 Triune Revalidation).

## Findings
- Halt supremacy preserved; ambiguity resolves to DENY + AUDIT.
- No execution, autonomy, ticks, persistence, or envelope instantiation implied.
- Axiom-first repair ordering preserved; no hotfix or contextual bypass.
- No recursion or execution re-permission implied.
- Authority boundaries preserved; no moral standing or final judgment claims.

## Verdict
**PASS — No contradictions observed.**

This audit is non-operational and governance-binding only.
