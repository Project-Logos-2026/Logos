# Phase-Z Audit Closure Criteria (Design Only)

Phase-Z may be closed if and only if:

- Authorization classes are explicitly defined
- Default authority remains DENY
- Revocation is explicit and immediate
- Phase-Y mediation is referenced, not collapsed
- Phase-X halt supremacy is restated and preserved
- No authorization is granted unless explicitly ratified
