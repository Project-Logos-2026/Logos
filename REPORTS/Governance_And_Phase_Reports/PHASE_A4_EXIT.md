# Phase A₄ Exit Record — Autonomy Evaluation Framework

**Phase:** A₄  
**Status:** CLOSED  
**Closure Type:** Design-Only Semantic Closure  
**Authority Granted:** NONE  
**Execution Enabled:** NO  
**Autonomy:** DENIED

---

## Closure Basis

Phase A₄ (Autonomy Evaluation Framework) is formally closed based on the existence
and validation of the following design-only artifacts:

1. `Autonomy_Evaluation_Framework.md`
2. `Phase_A4_Design_Artifact.md`

These documents collectively define the complete semantic framework for
**evaluating autonomy eligibility without granting or enabling autonomy**.

---

## Verification Assertions

At closure time, the following conditions are true:

- No execution logic exists
- No authority mutation exists
- No planning or memory enablement exists
- No persistence or continuation exists
- Privation supremacy remains binding
- Evaluation semantics do not imply transition
- Autonomy remains explicitly denied

Any system behavior contradicting the above constitutes a governance failure.

---

## Forward Constraint

With Phase A₄ closed:

- Entry into **Phase A₅ (Authority Granting Semantics)** is permitted
  **only at the design-definition level**
- No authority may be granted without explicit A₅ closure
- No runtime enforcement is authorized

---

## Final Statement

This record serves as the **authoritative procedural signal** that Phase A₄
is closed in the repository and may be treated as frozen.
