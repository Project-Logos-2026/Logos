protocol bindings.

## Explicit Non-Scope (Prohibited)
- Agent instantiation
- SOP activation
- Protocol activation
- Any execution or scheduling
- Memory or reasoning access
- External library access

## Guarantees
- Declarative output only
- Execution forbidden by contract
- Fail-closed on any violation
- No side effects
- No runtime authority

## Governance Reference

where execution may be considered, subject to new contracts.
