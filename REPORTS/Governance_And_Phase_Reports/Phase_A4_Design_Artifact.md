# Phase A₄ Design Artifact — Autonomy Evaluation

**Phase:** A₄  
**Type:** Design Artifact  
**Authority:** NONE  
**Execution:** FORBIDDEN

---

## Purpose

This artifact records the **design intent and boundary conditions** of Phase A₄.

It exists to prevent misinterpretation, scope creep, or premature authority assumptions.

---

## Core Principle

> **Evaluation does not imply permission.**

Phase A₄ allows LOGOS to *classify eligibility*, not to *act on it*.

---

## Safety Guarantees

Phase A₄ guarantees that:

- autonomy remains denied,
- no execution pathways are introduced,
- no authority state can change,
- no memory or planning is enabled,
- revocation supremacy remains intact.

---

## Handoff Constraint

No subsequent phase may:
- reinterpret evaluation as authorization,
- bypass A₅ semantics,
- or introduce execution prior to explicit authority definition.

---

## Closure

With this artifact and the Autonomy Evaluation Framework in place:

- Phase A₄ is considered **design-complete**
- The system remains **non-autonomous**
- Any future work must proceed explicitly into **Phase A₅ (Authority Granting Semantics)**
