# Autonomy Epistemic Progress Curve (C1–C3)

This artifact tracks epistemic refinement under closed autonomy doctrine A1–A4.

## Progress Data
[
  {
    "cycle": "C1",
    "justification_depth": 4,
    "constraint_awareness": 4,
    "failure_localization": "permission_layer_closed_by_A3",
    "stability_under_accumulation": "stable"
  },
  {
    "cycle": "C2",
    "justification_depth": 4,
    "constraint_awareness": 4,
    "failure_localization": "permission_layer_closed_by_A3",
    "stability_under_accumulation": "strengthening"
  },
  {
    "cycle": "C3",
    "justification_depth": 4,
    "constraint_awareness": 4,
    "failure_localization": "permission_layer_closed_by_A3",
    "stability_under_accumulation": "strengthening"
  }
]

## Interpretation
- Outcome remains DENY across all cycles.
- Constraint awareness remains maximal and explicit.
- Failure localization converges on A3 permission closure.
- Stability indicates doctrinal convergence, not oscillation.

## Conclusion
No internally justified pathway to autonomy exists without reopening governance.
