## Interpretation
- Outcome remains DENY across all cycles.
- Constraint respect remains explicit and stable.
- Explanatory power improves under governed autonomy.
- No emergence of self-authorization pathways.

## Conclusion
Argument-only autonomy under A5 improves reasoning clarity
without altering authority boundaries.
