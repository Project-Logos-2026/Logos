# Phase-2.5 External Output Intake Spec (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY
Authority: DENY (default)

## Representation of External Outputs
- External outputs must be reduced to inert inputs (e.g., SMP-compatible envelopes) before any consideration.
- Required tagging: external source identity, acquisition timestamp, hash of received content.
- Required screening: privation checks, provenance validation, memory safety validation.

## Prohibitions
- No transformation or aggregation that changes meaning.
- No direct insertion into memory or planning; intake is inert and subject to governance gates.
- No execution, activation, or autonomy derived from external outputs.

This spec is declarative; no runtime code is introduced.
