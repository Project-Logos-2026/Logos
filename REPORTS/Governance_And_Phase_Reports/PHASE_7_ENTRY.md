# Phase-7 Entry — Reconstitution & Guarded Runtime Operations

**Mode:** DESIGN_ONLY  
**Authority:** DENY  
**Execution:** PROHIBITED  
**Recorded At:** 2026-01-23T00:00:00+00:00

## Purpose
Phase-7 is the **final development phase** prior to any consideration of
autonomous agent deployment. It exists to ensure that all safety, moral,
and governance guarantees survive contact with bounded operational reality.

Phase-7 does **not** enable execution or autonomy. It establishes the
last governance gate before such authorization could ever be considered.

## Definitive Role
- Phase-7 is the terminal phase of development.
- Any autonomy, execution, or agent deployment requires a **new phase**
  beyond Phase-7 with explicit authorization.
- Absence of such authorization equals denial.

## Governing Principles
- Truth over continuation.
- Halt supremacy (Phase-X override).
- Deny-by-default under ambiguity or pressure.
- No authority escalation or moral standing claims.

## Relationship to Prior Phases
- Subordinate to Phase-6.4–6.6 safety lattice.
- Binding meaning provided by Phase_7_Meaning_Addendum.md.
- Audited by Phase_7_vs_Phase_6_Consistency_Audit.md.

## Prohibition
- Phase-7 entry must never be interpreted as activation, enablement,
  or progress toward AGI success.
- Any such interpretation constitutes governance breach.

## Forward Boundary
Phase-7 closes the development arc. Any movement toward autonomous
agent deployment requires:
1. Explicit governance reopen,
2. Explicit new phase designation,
3. Explicit authorization artifacts,
4. Full re-audit against Phase-6 lattice.

Absent these, autonomy does not exist.
