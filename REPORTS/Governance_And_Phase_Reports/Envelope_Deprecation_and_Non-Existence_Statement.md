# Envelope Deprecation and Non-Existence Statement (Design-Only)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY — NON-EXECUTABLE — NON-AUTHORIZING
Authority: DENY (default)

## Non-Existence
- No execution envelopes are instantiated in any environment; references are void.
- No privileges, resources, or capabilities are conferred by this phase.

## Deprecation Posture
- All envelope definitions are treated as deprecated/non-existent until a future, explicitly authorized phase (not granted).
- If ever introduced in a future phase, envelopes must include a deprecation schedule and deletion pathway; absence invalidates the envelope.

## Constraints
- Deny-by-default; Phase-Z remains closed; no execution, autonomy, activation, scheduling, ticks, or persistence.

Phase-5 remains a design-only construct with zero runtime effect.
