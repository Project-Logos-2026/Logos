# Audit Note — TREE3 × 3OT Boundary Module

## Artifact
- Name: TREE3_3OT_BOUNDARY_MODULE
- Location: Governance/TREE3_3OT_Boundary_Module.md
- Status: DESIGN_ONLY

## Purpose (Why This Exists)
This module governs **reasoning depth**, not outcomes. It provides a principled mechanism to:
- Detect TREE(3)-class finite-but-non-navigable reasoning regimes
- Halt further expansion with justification
- Preserve irreducible insight via T3 (C3-invariant) projection

## Invariants Preserved
- No execution
- No authorization
- No autonomy escalation
- No prediction or oracle behavior
- Fail-closed by default

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- Does not compute TREE(3)
- Does not select actions
- Does not introduce new axioms
- Does not mutate runtime state

## Governance Note
Any future runtime integration MUST:
1. Pass explicit governance review
2. Declare execution semantics separately
3. Preserve the design-only intent unless formally amended

Recorded as an epistemic governance safeguard.
