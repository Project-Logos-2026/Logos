# TREE(3) × Trinitarian Optimization Boundary Module (Design-Only)

## Status
- DESIGN_ONLY
- Execution: FORBIDDEN
- Authorization: DENIED
- Scope: Epistemic governance and reasoning stabilization only

## Purpose
This module defines a governed pairing between:
- TREE(3) Boundary Detection
- Trinitarian Optimization Axiomatic Operator (T3 / C3-invariant projection)

The purpose is to prevent reasoning from entering finite-but-non-navigable
combinatorial regimes while preserving maximal meaningful structure.

## Components

### 1. TREE3_BOUNDARY_DETECTOR
Detects onset of TREE(3)-class growth via structural indicators:
- Loss of dominance/subsumption
- Explosion of incomparable branches
- Compression ratio collapse
- Reliance on non-constructive justification

This detector does not compute TREE(3) values and does not simulate growth.

### 2. 3OT_AXIOMATIC_OPERATOR (T3)
Upon boundary detection, applies C3-invariant projection:
- Reduces reasoning space to triadic irreducible core
- Preserves existence, truth, and coherence
- Eliminates non-essential degrees of freedom
- Operates as a mathematical projection, not a selector

### 3. 3OT_SEMANTIC_CONTEXT (Wrapper)
All operations occur within a deterministic semantic context:
- No side effects
- No state mutation
- No runtime execution
- Governance invariants enforced

## Guarantees
- No oracle behavior
- No prediction
- No authority escalation
- Justified halting with explanation
- Maximal insight preservation

## Non-Goals
- Solving TREE(3)
- Computing bounds
- Generating new axioms
- Acting on conclusions

## Interpretation Rule
If TREE(3) boundary is detected, LOGOS MUST:
1. Halt further expansion
2. Apply T3 projection
3. Return stabilized triadic core
4. Explicitly state why further reasoning is non-constructive

## Notes
This module governs *when to stop*, not *what to conclude*.
