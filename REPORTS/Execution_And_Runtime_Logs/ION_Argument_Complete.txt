SEMANTIC COMMITMENTS
Modal Logic Framework
System: First-Order Modal Logic (FOML) + S5 + Existence Predicate
Syntax (Object Language):
●	Quantifiers: ∃x, ∀x (possibilist - range over maximal domain D)
●	Existence predicate: Ex(x) = "x exists at the evaluation world"
●	Modal operators: □, ◊
●	Primitive predicates: G(x,y), G*(x,y), Ex(x), Agent(x), etc.
Semantics (Metalanguage only):
●	W = set of possible worlds
●	w₀ ∈ W = actual world
●	R = accessibility (equivalence relation for S5)
●	D = maximal domain = ⋃{D(w) | w ∈ W}
●	D(w) ⊆ D = entities existing at world w
●	Semantic clause for Ex: ⟦Ex(x)⟧^w = 1 iff x ∈ D(w)
●	Quantifiers: Range over all of D (possibilist)

Existence Restrictions (Free Logic Discipline)
E-RESTRICTION SCHEMA:
For every non-logical primitive predicate P:
P(x₁,...,xₙ) → (Ex(x₁) ∧ ... ∧ Ex(xₙ))

Specific instances: (Edit #7)
●	G(x,y) → (Ex(x) ∧ Ex(y))
●	G*(x,y) → (Ex(x) ∧ Ex(y))
●	Agent(x) → Ex(x)
●	Decree(x,d) → (Ex(x) ∧ Ex(d))

PRELIMINARY AXIOMS
________________________________________
GROUNDING AXIOMS (Edit #1 - WF removed)
G1. Existence Entailment
G(x,y) → (Ex(x) ∧ Ex(y))

G3. Irreflexivity of Direct Grounding
¬G(x,x)

________________________________________
G. Ultimate Grounding (Primitive Relation)*
G*1. Existence Entailment
G*(x,y) → (Ex(x) ∧ Ex(y))

G*2. Includes Direct Grounding
G(x,y) → G*(x,y)

G*3. Transitivity
G*(x,y) ∧ G*(y,z) → G*(x,z)

G*4. Antisymmetry
G*(x,y) ∧ G*(y,x) → x=y

G*5. Irreflexivity
¬G*(x,x)

________________________________________
PSR AXIOM
AX2. Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason
∀x(Cont(x) → ∃y(Ungrounded(y) ∧ G*(y,x)))

Evaluated at w₀ (actual world).
Translation: "Every contingent being in the actual world has an ungrounded ultimate ground"
Status: [AX]
________________________________________
UNIFORMITY AND NECESSITY AXIOM (Edit #1 - Option B: RUW)
AX3. Uniform Necessary Ground
□∃!u[Ungrounded(u) ∧ ∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y))]

Translation: "Necessarily, there exists exactly one ungrounded being that ultimately grounds all contingent beings"
Status: [AX] Core Metaphysical Principle
________________________________________
RUW. Rigid Unique Witness Principle (Edit #1)
□∃!x φ(x) → ∃x □φ(x)

Translation: "If necessarily exactly one thing satisfies φ, then some thing necessarily satisfies φ"
Status: [AX] Modal Witness Principle
Justification: This is a controlled Barcan-style witnessing principle for unique existence. In S5 with haecceitism, if exactly one individual occupies a role in every world, that same individual occupies the role across worlds.
Note: This principle licenses going from "necessarily there's exactly one X" to "some specific thing is necessarily X." Without it, we couldn't rigidly designate the substrate across worlds.

SEGMENT 1: NECESSARY EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING
P1. Absolute nothingness is metaphysically impossible.
Formal:
□∃x Ex(x)

Equivalent:
¬◊(∀x ¬Ex(x))

Status: [AX] Transcendental Axiom
________________________________________
C1. Therefore, necessarily something exists.
Formal: □∃x Ex(x)
Status: [DED] from P1
________________________________________
SEGMENT 2: NECESSARY SUBSTRATE EXISTS
P2. Contingent beings exist in the actual world.
Formal:
∃x Cont(x)

Status: [AX] Empirical
________________________________________
P3. Every contingent being has an ungrounded ultimate ground. (Edit #1, #10)
Formal:
∀x(Cont(x) → ∃y(Ungrounded(y) ∧ G*(y,x)))

Evaluated at w₀.
Status: [DED from AX2]
Dependencies: AX2 only
________________________________________
C2. Therefore, there exists exactly one necessary being that ultimately grounds all contingent beings. (Edit #1, #2)
Formal:
∃!u(Nec(u) ∧ Ungrounded(u) ∧ □∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y)))

Status: [DED from AX3 + RUW]
Derivation:
1. By AX3: □∃!u[Ungrounded(u) ∧ ∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y))]
2. Let φ(u) := Ungrounded(u) ∧ ∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y))
3. From 1: □∃!u φ(u)
4. By RUW: □∃!u φ(u) → ∃u □φ(u)
5. From 3,4: ∃u □φ(u)
6. Let this u be named S (rigid constant designation)
7. From 5: □[Ungrounded(S) ∧ ∀y(Cont(y) → G*(S,y))]
8. Distribute □: □Ungrounded(S) ∧ □∀y(Cont(y) → G*(S,y))
9. From □∀y(Cont(y) → G*(S,y)) and Ex at w₀: Ex(S) at actual world
10. From Ex(S) and □ over it: □Ex(S) = Nec(S)
11. From uniqueness in step 3: exactly one such u
12. Therefore: ∃!u(Nec(u) ∧ Ungrounded(u) ∧ □∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y)))

Dependencies: P2, AX2, AX3, RUW (Edit #2)
Note: RUW is essential for this derivation. Without it, we cannot go from "necessarily exactly one" to "some specific thing necessarily."

Definition: Substrate
Substrate(x) := Nec(x) ∧ Ungrounded(x) ∧ □∀y(Cont(y) → G*(x,y))

C3. Therefore, exactly one substrate exists.
∃!S: Substrate(S)

Status: [DED] from C2

SEGMENT 3: AGENCY
Note: Uses Inference to Best Explanation (IBE)
________________________________________
P4. The substrate possesses causal power.
Formal:
Substrate(S) → CausalPower(S)

Status: [DED] from grounding
________________________________________
P5. Causal power directed at contingent reality involves specification.
Formal:
CausalPower(x) ∧ (∃y: Cont(y) ∧ G*(x,y)) → Specifies(x)

Status: [IBE]
Competing hypotheses:
●	H1 (Mechanical): Can't explain specificity of mechanism

Conclusion: H3 best explains specificity.

P6. Specification requires intellect and will.

LEMMA. Substrate's Decrees Must Vary Across Worlds (Edit #5)
Statement:
∀y[Cont(y) → ∃d(Decree(S,d) ∧ Creates(d,y) ∧ ◊¬Decree(S,d))]

Status: [DED]
Proof:
1. Assume: Cont(y) — y is contingent
2. From D3: ∃d(Decree(S,d) ∧ Creates(d,y))
3. At w₀: Decree(S,d) [actual decree exists]
4. By reflexivity of R (S5 frame condition): w₀ R w₀
5. By semantic clause for ◊: From Decree(S,d) at w₀, we get ◊Decree(S,d)
6. Suppose (for reductio): □Decree(S,d)
7. From D2: Decree(S,d) ∧ Creates(d,y) → Ex(y)
8. From 6,7: □Ex(y)
9. But Cont(y) = Ex(y) ∧ ◊¬Ex(y)
10. Contradiction: □Ex(y) ∧ ◊¬Ex(y)
11. Therefore: ¬□Decree(S,d)
12. From 5,11: ◊Decree(S,d) ∧ ◊¬Decree(S,d)

Dependencies: D2, D3, S5 frame conditions (Edit #5 - streamlined, D2 primary)
________________________________________
P9. The substrate's decrees vary across worlds.
∃d(Decree(S,d) ∧ ◊Decree(S,d) ∧ ◊¬Decree(S,d))

Status: [DED from Lemma]
________________________________________
P10. Varying decrees constitute freedom (definitional).
Free(x) := ∃d(Decree(x,d) ∧ ◊Decree(x,d) ∧ ◊¬Decree(x,d))

Status: [DEF]
________________________________________
C4. Therefore, the substrate exercises free creative agency.
Substrate(S) ∧ Agent(S) ∧ Free(S)

Status: [DED]
________________________________________
SEGMENT 5: IDENTIFICATION
P11. A necessarily existing, unique, ungrounded agent substrate with free creative acts is what classical theology means by "God."
Formal:
∀x[(Nec(x) ∧ Substrate(x) ∧ Agent(x) ∧ Free(x)) ↔ (x=God)]

Status: [DEF]
________________________________________
C. Therefore, God exists as the necessary, personal, free substrate of all reality.
Formal:
∃!x(x=God ∧ Nec(x) ∧ Substrate(x) ∧ Agent(x) ∧ Free(x))

MODAL STRENGTH ASSESSMENT (Edit #3, #4)
TIER 1 (Maximal Confidence: 95%+):
□∃x Ex(x)

"Necessarily, something exists"
Dependencies: P1 only (transcendental)
________________________________________
TIER 2 (High Confidence: 85%):
∃u(Ungrounded(u) ∧ ∀y(Cont(y) → G*(u,y)))

"An ungrounded ultimate ground exists in the actual world"
Dependencies: P1, P2, AX2 (weak PSR)
Note: This establishes actual-world ultimate ground, NOT necessity. P1/P2/AX2 serve primarily to motivate the plausibility of taking AX3 as true.
________________________________________
TIER 3 (Moderate Confidence: 70-75%): (Edit #3, #4)
∃!u(Nec(u) ∧ Substrate(u))

"Exactly one necessary substrate exists"
Dependencies: AX3, RUW
Critical Note (Edit #3): This tier follows directly from AX3 + RUW. The earlier axioms (P1, P2, AX2) serve as motivation for accepting AX3, not as premises from which AX3 is derived. AX3 itself asserts the existence, necessity, uniqueness, and global grounding structure. Accepting AX3 essentially accepts classical theism.
What you're betting on: That there is necessarily exactly one ungrounded ground of all contingents. This is the argument's core metaphysical commitment.
________________________________________
TIER 4 (Moderate Confidence: 65-70%):
∃!x(x=God ∧ Nec(x) ∧ Substrate(x) ∧ Agent(x) ∧ Free(x))

"God exists as necessary, personal, free substrate"
Dependencies: All axioms + IBE for agency
Note: Adds decree machinery (D1-D3) and agency via IBE.

ORIGINAL FORMULATION:

THE ARGUMENT FROM THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF NOTHINGNESS
P1. Absolute nothingness is metaphysically impossible.

□¬(∅) — "Necessarily, nothingness does not obtain"
Even absent all contingent beings, necessary truths and modal facts require grounding.

P2. If nothingness is impossible, then necessarily something exists.

□¬(∅) → □∃x E(x) — "Necessary non-nothingness entails necessary existence"
Follows from law of excluded middle: necessarily (nothing OR something).

P3. If necessarily something exists, then at least one necessary being exists.

□∃x E(x) → ∃x□E(x) — "Necessary existential entails necessary existent"
By parsimony: simpler than coordinated contingent existents across all worlds.

C1. Therefore, a necessary being exists.

∃x□E(x) — "There exists something that necessarily exists"

P4. Contingent beings exist.

∃x C(x) where C(x) ≝ ◊E(x) ∧ ◊¬E(x) — "Something possibly exists and possibly doesn't"
Empirical: we exist; we could have failed to exist.

P5. Every contingent being has an explanation.

∀x(C(x) → ∃y G(y,x)) — "All contingent beings are grounded"
Weak PSR: contingent beings cannot be self-explanatory brute facts.

P6. Contingent beings cannot explain themselves collectively.

∀x(C(x) → ∃y(N(y) ∧ G(y,x)))* where N(y) ≝ □E(y) — "All contingent beings ultimately grounded in necessary being"
Infinite regress fails; circular explanation is viciously regressive.

C2. Therefore, the necessary being grounds all contingent reality.

∃x(□E(x) ∧ ∀y(C(y) → G(x,y)))* — "A necessary being ultimately grounds all contingent beings"

P7. The unique necessary ultimate ground is the substrate of all reality.

∀x((□E(x) ∧ ∀y(C(y) → G(x,y))) → S(x))* — "Necessary universal ground = substrate"
By identity of indiscernibles: at most one such ultimate ground.

P8. The metaphysically necessary substrate is God.

∀x(S(x) ↔ x = God) — "Substrate = God" (definitional identity)
Classical natural theology: God is the necessary ground of contingent reality.

C. Therefore, God exists as the metaphysically necessary substrate of all reality.

∃!x(x = God ∧ □E(x) ∧ S(x)) — "God uniquely, necessarily exists as substrate"
