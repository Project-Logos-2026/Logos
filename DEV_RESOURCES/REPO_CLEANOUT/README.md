# REPO_CLEANOUT — Temporary Maintenance Sink

Status: NON-CANONICAL  
Authority: NONE  
Execution: FORBIDDEN  
Scan Inclusion: EXCLUDED  
Deletion: SAFE AFTER CLEANUP COMPLETION

## Purpose

This directory is a **temporary sink** for all repository maintenance artifacts, including but not limited to:

- Cleanup reports
- Audit outputs
- Diff results
- Classification ledgers
- Equivalence mappings
- One-off repair diagnostics

Its existence prevents cleanup work from polluting the canonical repository surface.

## Invariants

- Nothing in this directory is authoritative.
- Nothing in this directory may be imported, aggregated, or scanned.
- No runtime, governance, or DRAC logic may depend on contents here.
- The entire directory may be deleted once cleanup is complete.

## Enforcement Rule

Every VS Code prompt generated by GPT that produces maintenance output
MUST explicitly route all outputs into this directory or a subdirectory thereof.

Violation of this rule constitutes a workflow defect.
