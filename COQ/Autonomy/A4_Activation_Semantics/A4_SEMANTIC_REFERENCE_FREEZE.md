# A4 — Activation Semantics — SEMANTIC-ONLY REFERENCE

## Status
FROZEN — REFERENCE ONLY

## Purpose
This marker freezes A4 as a semantic reference.
A4 defines the *meaning* of activation without granting
permission, capability, or authority.

## Doctrine Closure
With this freeze, the autonomy doctrine is closed across:

- A1 — Non-Escalation
- A2 — Self-Stabilization
- A3 — Delegated Authorization (DENIED)
- A4 — Activation Semantics (REFERENCE)

No axiom in A1–A4, individually or collectively, enables autonomy.

## Invariants
- Autonomy remains denied by default.
- No activation mechanism exists.
- No self-authorization exists.
- No semantic document may be treated as executable authority.

## Conditions to Reopen
Any change to A4 would require:
1. Explicit governance decision.
2. New audit marker superseding this freeze.
3. Re-evaluation of A1–A3 for consistency.

Until then, A4 is reference-only.
