# LOGOS Governance Model

Governance is the highest authority in the LOGOS System.

---

## Default Posture

- **DENY**
- **FAIL-CLOSED**
- **NO AUTONOMY**

Anything not explicitly permitted is prohibited.

---

## Governance Responsibilities

Governance artifacts define:

- What the system may analyze
- What it may not claim
- What transitions are forbidden
- What remains design-only

---

## Design-Only Artifacts

Design-only means:

- No execution
- No activation
- No implication of future permission

Design-only artifacts are descriptive constraints, not dormant code.

---

## Violations

Any change that:

- Implies agency
- Implies intent
- Implies execution
- Collapses simulation into action

…is a governance violation.
