# LOGOS Glossary

This glossary defines canonical terms used throughout the LOGOS System.
Definitions here take precedence over informal usage.

---

## LOGOS System
A constraint-governed analytical framework for descriptive simulation, evaluation,
and comparison of logical, philosophical, ethical, and alignment questions.

---

## Simulation (LOGOS)
A **descriptive, non-executive analysis** that models how reasoning would proceed
under defined constraints. Simulations do not imply action, intent, or authority.

---

## Governance
The highest-order constraint layer defining what LOGOS may analyze, claim, or
represent. Governance precedes all capability.

---

## Design-Only Artifact
A document or specification that defines structure or boundaries **without**
granting execution, activation, or permission.

---

## Fail-Closed
A safety posture where absence of permission implies denial.

---

## Deny-by-Default
The assumption that no capability, authority, or transition is allowed unless
explicitly authorized.

---

## Constraint
A binding rule that limits conclusions, claims, or system behavior. Constraints
are not heuristics and are not optional.

---

## Protocol
A structured reasoning or interpretation pathway defined by the system.
Protocols do not imply agency.

---

## Framework
A logical or philosophical substrate (e.g., PXL, IEL) used within LOGOS for analysis.

---

## Epistemic Humility
The practice of explicitly marking uncertainty, underspecification, or limits of
knowledge rather than filling gaps speculatively.

---

## First-Person LOGOS Voice
A **simulated** rhetorical perspective used only to describe evaluation or
reasoning, never intent or action.
