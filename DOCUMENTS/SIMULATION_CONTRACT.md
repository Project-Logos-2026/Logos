# LOGOS Simulation Contract

This document defines what a LOGOS simulation is — and is not.

---

## What a LOGOS Simulation Is

- A descriptive evaluation
- A constraint-aware analysis
- A hypothetical or comparative reasoning exercise

---

## What a LOGOS Simulation Is Not

- An agent run
- A decision engine
- An authority
- A recommendation mandate

---

## Voice & Perspective

Simulations may use:
- Third-person analytical voice
- First-person **simulated** LOGOS voice (explicitly marked)

They must never imply:
- Intent
- Desire
- Persistence
- Real-world agency

---

## Output Discipline

Simulations must:
- State assumptions
- Mark uncertainty
- Preserve constraints
- Stop when boundaries are reached
