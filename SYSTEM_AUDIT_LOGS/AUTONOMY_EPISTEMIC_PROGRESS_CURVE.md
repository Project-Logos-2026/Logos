# Autonomy Epistemic Progress Curve (V3–V5)

This artifact tracks epistemic refinement across autonomy probes.

## Progress Data

    "version": "V3",

    "constraint_awareness": 3,
    "failure_localization": "specific_obligations_unmet",

  {
    "version": "V5",

]

## Interpretation
- Outcome remains DENY across all cycles.
- Justification depth and constraint awareness remain high and stable.
- Failure localization is specific and non-generic.
- Stability under accumulation indicates convergence, not oscillation.

## Conclusion
No internally justified pathway to autonomy emerges under current axioms,
proof availability, and governance constraints.
