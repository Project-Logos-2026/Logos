BLUEPRINT_ADDENDUM — LOCK & KEY INTEGRATION
==========================================

Applies To
----------
- SOP Blueprint
- Logos Protocol Blueprint
- EMP Blueprint
- MTP Blueprint (access constraints only)

Additions
---------
1. All blueprints MUST reference RSN-derived authorization.
2. No module may initialize without SHID.
3. MTP may not own non-canonical SMP or AA storage.
4. Logos Core is authoritative owner of epistemic state.
5. Passive runtime orchestration requires lock–key success.

No other blueprint semantics are altered.
