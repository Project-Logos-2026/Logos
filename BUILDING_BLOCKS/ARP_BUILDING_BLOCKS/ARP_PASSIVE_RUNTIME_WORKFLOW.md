# ARP_PASSIVE_RUNTIME_WORKFLOW.md

## Purpose
This document defines the **passive runtime (P2) workflow** for **I₃ working in conjunction with ARP**.
It mirrors the I₂ + MTP promotion-preparation model.

---

## Passive Runtime Role of I₃ + ARP

During P2, I₃ is responsible for:
- Evaluating reasoning completeness
- Identifying insufficiencies or conflicts
- Preparing reasoning-based promotion requests

ARP provides:
- Reasoning expansion
- Aggregation and validation
- Meta-reasoning artifacts

---

## Non-Canonical Reasoning Targets

ARP works over SMPs that:
- Failed reasoning sufficiency
- Contain unresolved logical conflicts
- Lack confidence thresholds
- Are flagged as non-canonical by Logos

These are stored as **non-canonical SMPs with attached SMP-AAs**.

---

## I3AA (I₃-Derived Append Artifact)

### Definition
**I3AA** is a promotion-preparatory artifact generated by I₃.

It contains:
- Reasoning deficiency analysis
- Newly derived reasoning context
- Confidence improvements or conflict reductions
- Explicit promotion rationale

I3AA:
- Does not promote
- Does not assert truth
- Is advisory only

---

## Passive Runtime Workflow

1. ARP performs additional reasoning passes
2. I₃ evaluates reasoning sufficiency
3. If promotion conditions appear satisfied:
   - I₃ generates an I3AA
   - SMP metadata is updated (still non-canonical)
4. SMP + I3AA are sent to Logos

---

## System-Wide Processing Trigger

Upon receipt:
- Logos pulls all SMP-AAs
- Reprocesses SMP with I3AA as reasoning lens
- Decides promotion, reclassification, or rejection

Only Logos can approve system-wide execution.

---

## Priority Rules

1. Reasoning-near-canonical SMPs
2. SMPs with partial confidence satisfaction
3. Deeply conflicted or speculative SMPs
