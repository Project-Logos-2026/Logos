## Master list: the 18 IEL domains

1. **AestheticoPraxis**
   Domain: aesthetics / beauty-as-experience.
   Role: aesthetic evaluation and taste-like constraints (distinct from “value” in AxioPraxis).

2. **AnthroPraxis**
   Domain: anthropology (personhood, social roles, normed interaction).
   Repo note: has subdomains including **BioPraxis** and **Life**.

3. **AxioPraxis**
   Domain: axiology (value / goodness / beauty-value constraints).
   Role: value-weighting overlay and “ought-weight” constraints.

4. **ChronoPraxis**
   Domain: time / temporal structure.
   Role: temporal ordering, sequence constraints, temporal consistency.

5. **CosmoPraxis**
   Domain: cosmology (explicitly described as unifying Chrono + Topo).
   Role: spatiotemporal worldview structure (time + space coherence).

6. **ErgoPraxis**
   Domain: work/efficiency/optimization-in-action (ergonomic action constraints).
   Role: practicality/efficiency overlays on plans and operations.

7. **GlorioPraxis**
   Domain: “glory” / honor / worship-shaped valuation.
   Role: a specialized valuation axis distinct from generic axiology (likely theological/teleological emphasis).

8. **GnosiPraxis**
   Domain: knowledge / epistemic structure (epistemology-like overlay).
   Role: belief/knowledge constraints, conservativity/cross-checking motifs.

9. **MakarPraxis**
   Domain: “makarios” / blessedness / flourishing.
   Role: flourishing-oriented evaluation (often: wellbeing + virtue + telos alignment).

10. **ModalPraxis**
    Domain: modality (modal structure and modal reasoning overlay).
    Repo note: your project mapping says **ModalPraxis is equivalent to TopoPraxis** (legacy alias), but **both folders exist** in this snapshot, so treat them as *distinct code artifacts until explicitly consolidated*.

11. **PraxeoPraxis**
    Domain: praxeology (action theory / action structures).
    Role: action primitives, action composition, action justification scaffolding.

12. **RelatioPraxis**
    Domain: relations / relational structure.
    Role: relation-typing, relation consistency, relational inference constraints.

13. **TeloPraxis**
    Domain: teleology (ends, purposes, goal-structure).
    Role: goal formation and purpose constraints; “why” structure in planning.

14. **ThemiPraxis**
    Domain: themis / law / justice / norm frames.
    Role: normative/legal constraint overlay; “permitted/forbidden/required” structure.

15. **TheoPraxis**
    Domain: theology.
    Role: theological constraints and doctrine-shaped overlays (as encoded in your system design).

16. **TopoPraxis**
    Domain: space / spatial logic (“regions, adjacency, spatial reasoning” in the overview doc).
    Role: spatial constraints for world models, navigation, adjacency, containment, etc.

17. **TropoPraxis**
    Domain: tropes / modes-of-expression / rhetoric / linguistic form.
    Role: style/representation constraints (how meaning is expressed, not just what is true).

18. **ZelosPraxis**
    Domain: zeal / motivation / drive / intensity-of-will.
    Role: motivational dynamics as constraints or weights in planning and commitment.

## How they tie into PXO (conceptual integration)

Your request uses “PXO” as the integration target. The repo snapshot you provided does not contain the literal string “PXO” in the ARP/IEL subtree, so the safest accurate framing is **architectural** rather than claiming a concrete module name.

In LOGOS terms, the IELs tie into PXO like this:

* **PXL** supplies the **core modal/constructive logic gate** and the “allowed inference skeleton.”
* **PXO** (as you’re using it) is the **praxis-shaped ontology layer**: the structured “what exists / what kinds / what relations / what constraints” layer that ARP reasoners consume when producing or validating SMPs.
* **IEL domains** are the **domain-specific ontology+constraint overlays** that:

  1. define *domain vocabularies* (types/kinds/relations),
  2. define *domain constraints* (what counts as coherent within that domain),
  3. provide *domain tests/theorems* (eventually proof-carrying guarantees),
  4. feed ARP with domain-labeled structures so PXO isn’t a flat ontology, but a **typed lattice of praxis domains**.

A practical way to think of it:

* **PXO is the shared “world-structure substrate.”**
* **IELs are the domain modules that populate and constrain PXO** so ARP can reason “as biology,” “as time,” “as justice,” “as teleology,” etc., without mixing rules improperly.

## Quick mapping: what each IEL contributes to PXO

* **ChronoPraxis →** temporal entities/relations (before/after, duration, sequence)
* **TopoPraxis →** spatial entities/relations (region, adjacency, containment)
* **CosmoPraxis →** spatiotemporal synthesis constraints (space–time coherence)
* **GnosiPraxis →** epistemic objects (belief/knowledge status, justification constraints)
* **AxioPraxis / AestheticoPraxis / MakarPraxis →** valuation layers (value, beauty-experience, flourishing)
* **ThemiPraxis →** normative/legal objects (obligation/permission/prohibition frames)
* **TeloPraxis →** goal/telos objects (ends, purposes, goal coherence)
* **AnthroPraxis →** personhood/social-role objects (agents, roles, normed interaction)
* **PraxeoPraxis / ErgoPraxis →** action primitives + efficiency constraints
* **RelatioPraxis →** relation typing/consistency across the ontology graph
* **TheoPraxis / GlorioPraxis / ZelosPraxis →** theological/motivational overlays (specialized constraints/weights)
* **TropoPraxis →** representation/communication-form constraints (how SMPs are expressed)
