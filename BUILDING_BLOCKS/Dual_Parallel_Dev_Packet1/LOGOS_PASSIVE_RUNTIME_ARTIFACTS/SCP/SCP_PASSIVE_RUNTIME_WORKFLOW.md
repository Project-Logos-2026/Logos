# SCP_PASSIVE_RUNTIME_WORKFLOW.md

## Purpose
This document defines **passive runtime (P2) behavior** for **I₁ working in conjunction with SCP**.
It mirrors the I₂/MTP and I₃/ARP models, adapted to SCP’s signal- and constraint-centric role.

---

## Passive Runtime Role of I₁ + SCP

During P2, I₁ focuses on:
- Signal coherence
- Constraint satisfaction
- Stability and convergence analysis
- Detecting insufficient grounding or oscillation

SCP provides:
- Modal Vector Space examination
- Fractal traversal and extrapolation
- Baanock Data Node instantiation and recomposition
- Multi-domain inference and entailment analysis

---

## Non-Canonical SCP Targets

SCP operates on SMPs and AAs that:
- Failed signal coherence checks
- Exhibit instability or oscillation
- Lack sufficient constraint grounding
- Were previously rejected or deferred by Logos

These are maintained as **non-canonical SMPs with associated AAs** in MTP.

---

## I1AA (I₁-Derived Append Artifact)

### Definition
**I1AA** is a promotion-preparatory artifact generated by I₁.

It contains:
- Signal coherence analysis
- Constraint satisfaction evaluation
- Stability metrics
- Fractal convergence summaries
- Explicit promotion rationale

I1AA:
- Does not assert truth
- Does not promote SMPs
- Is advisory only

---

## Passive Runtime Workflow

1. SCP runs additional MVS / BDN analysis passes
2. I₁ evaluates stability, grounding, and coherence
3. If promotion conditions appear satisfied:
   - I₁ generates an I1AA
   - SMP metadata is updated (non-canonical)
4. SMP + I1AA are sent to Logos

---

## System-Wide Processing Trigger

Upon receipt:
- Logos pulls all associated AAs
- Reprocesses SMP using I1AA as signal/constraint lens
- Decides promotion, reclassification, or rejection

Only Logos may approve system-wide processing.

---

## Priority Rules

1. SMPs near stability threshold
2. SMPs with partial grounding
3. Deeply unstable or oscillatory SMPs
