# LOGOS Passive Runtime Artifact Bundle

## Purpose
This archive contains all artifacts generated in the passive-runtime convergence session.
It is intended for cross-session synchronization and review.

## Contents
- AA_Schemas: Canonical append artifact definitions
- Passive_Runtime: System-wide passive orchestration and flow
- Cognitive_Analysis: Rationale, risks, and cognitive/world-model alignment
- MTP / ARP / SCP / SOP: Blueprints, reuse maps, gap ledgers, passive workflows

## Status
All documents are design-final but implementation-pending.
They reflect the locked tri-agent, tri-cycle passive runtime model.

## Usage
Import into parallel session or VS Code for:
- Context synchronization
- Schema alignment
- Next-phase implementation planning
