# MTP_BLUEPRINT_DRAFT.md

## Status
DRAFT — DESIGN-ONLY — NON-EXECUTABLE

## Purpose
This document provides the **baseline blueprint** for the **Meaning Translation Protocol (MTP)** under the normalized LOGOS V1 architecture.

MTP is the **semantic workspace and meaning gateway** of the system.  
It owns end-to-end **Structured Meaning Packet (SMP)** generation, enrichment, translation, and **Append Artifact (AA)** management for all *non-canonical* meaning.

This blueprint also formalizes **passive runtime collaboration between MTP and the I₂ agent**, including the introduction of **I₂-derived Append Artifacts (I2AA)** and the conditions under which **system-wide processing may be requested**.

This document is design-only and does **not** authorize execution.

---

## High-Level Role

MTP is responsible for:
- Ingesting raw, unstructured input
- Generating canonical SMP structures
- Performing large-scale semantic enrichment
- Managing all non-canonical SMPs
- Storing and cataloging all Append Artifacts (AAs)
- Serving as the semantic preparation layer for potential CSP integration

MTP does **not**:
- Declare truth
- Promote SMPs to canonical status
- Execute goals
- Perform global orchestration
- Persist canonical memory

---

## Runtime Position

- MTP lives on the **Execution Side** of the runtime.
- MTP interfaces directly with:
  - I₂ (meaning / interpretation agent)
  - GUI ingress/egress
  - LLM integration points
- MTP outputs are advisory and preparatory.
- Canonical promotion decisions occur **only** via Logos and CSP.

## MTP/Core (Authoritative Meaning Workspace)

### Core Responsibilities

#### 1. SMP Generation
- Accepts raw natural language input from I₂ / GUI
- Applies:
  - Privation gating (I₂)
  - Input sanitation and encoding checks
- Instantiates SMP immediately after gating

#### 2. Canonical SMP Structure

```

Raw input is **never altered**. All enrichment is additive.

---

#### 3. Translation Compiler
- Compiles outputs from Tools into SMP-compatible structures
- Normalizes all translation products
- Preserves provenance for each derived element

---

#### 4. Append Artifact (AA) Storage Container

MTP owns the **authoritative workspace store** for:
- All non-canonical SMPs
- All Append Artifacts (AAs)

Properties:
- AAs are cryptographically bound to their originating SMP
- SMP headers store AA hash references only
- Full AA bodies are stored in the MTP AA container

This enables:
- Recall
- Comparison
- Recomposition
- Passive reprocessing

---

## Append Artifact Classes (MTP Scope)

### AA (General)
- ARP SMP-AAs
- EMP outputs
- Other protocol append artifacts

### I2AA (I₂-Derived Append Artifact) — Canonical New Class
- Generated by I₂ during passive runtime
- Represents promotion-preparatory work
- Contains:
  - Updated metadata
  - Condition-satisfaction analysis
  - Contextual reasoning
  - Explicit promotion rationale

I2AA does **not** promote SMPs.
It is a **request artifact**, not an authority artifact.

---

## MTP/Tools (Semantic Expansion & Translation)

### Responsibilities
- Natural language processing
- Semantic extraction
- Sentence transformation
- Lambda calculus translation
- Symbolic math translation
- Formal logic translation (PXL, IEL overlays)
- Multi-lens linguistic analysis

### External Libraries
- Tools are the only location where external libraries may be invoked
- All outputs are treated as advisory inputs
- No tool has authority to modify SMP state

---

## MTP/Nexus (Ingress / Egress)

### Standard Nexus Responsibilities
- Routing
- Lifecycle coordination
- Non-authoritative wiring

### Extended Responsibilities (Canonical)
- GUI input/output integration
- LLM integration hook points
- Input routing to Core
- Output routing from Core

The Nexus performs **no enrichment or reasoning**.

---

## Passive Runtime Operations (MTP + I₂)

### Classification of Non-Canonical SMPs
- Provisional (highest priority)
- Conditional (medium priority)
- Rejected (lowest priority)

Each SMP is tagged with:
- Why it is non-canonical
- What conditions must be satisfied for promotion

---

### Passive Runtime Behavior

During passive runtime (P2):

- I₂ binds to MTP
- MTP provides:
  - Non-canonical SMPs
  - All associated AAs
- I₂ performs domain-specific analysis
- MTP performs enrichment, comparison, and recomposition

Goal:
- Satisfy conditions required for promotion
- Prepare evidence, not decide outcome

---

### System-Wide Processing Request (I₂ Path)

If I₂ + MTP determine conditions may be satisfied:

1. I₂ generates an **I2AA**
2. SMP metadata is updated (non-canonical)
3. SMP + I2AA are sent to Logos as a **promotion request**
4. Logos:
   - Pulls all associated AAs via hash catalog
   - Reprocesses SMP with full historical context
   - Decides promotion, reclassification, or rejection

Only Logos can approve system-wide processing.

---

## CSP Boundary (Explicit)

- CSP stores **canonical SMPs only**
- No provisional, conditional, rejected SMPs enter CSP
- No AAs are persisted in CSP
- This prevents polluted memory rehydration

---

## Documentation Requirements

Required files:
- MANIFEST.md
- ORDER_OF_OPERATIONS.md
- STACK_POSITION.md
- RUNTIME_ROLE.md
- GOVERNANCE_SCOPE.md
- METADATA.json

Documentation is binding and non-executable.
