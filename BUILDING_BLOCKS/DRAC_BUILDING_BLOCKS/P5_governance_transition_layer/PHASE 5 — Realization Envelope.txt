# PHASE_5_REALIZATION_ENVELOPE.md
Status: CANONICAL | DESIGN-ONLY | AUTHORITATIVE
Authority: NONE
Execution: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
Phase: Phase 5 — Substage 5.3
Scope: Conditional realization constraints (non-authorizing)

---

## Semantic Synopsis (GPT Handoff)

Defines the non-authorizing realization envelope for Phase 5.  
Specifies which Phase 4 components *could ever be considered* for realization, under what governance gates, without granting execution authority.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **conditional realization envelope** for Phase 5.
It constrains *what may be proposed* in future phases without authorizing execution, implementation, or persistence.

---

## 2. Envelope Principle

- Descriptive, not permissive
- Constraints-only, not approvals
- Absence of explicit authorization implies **DENY**

---

## 3. Conditional Realization Map (Non-Authorizing)

Eligible components are limited to:

> **All stages defined in the Phase 4 Type Schema corpus (STAGE_1 through STAGE_8, excluding STAGE_7).**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Stage 1 — Session Init  
- Stage 2 — Profile Loader  
- Stage 3 — Baseline Assembler  
- Stage 4 — Artifact Overlay  
- Stage 5 — Reuse Decision  
- Stage 6 — Compilation  
- Stage 8 — Artifact Cataloger  

Explicit exclusions:
- Autonomy escalation
- Persistence enablement
- Runtime self-orchestration
- Any reinterpretation of Phase 4 semantics

---

## 4. Executable Eligibility Criteria (Necessary, Not Sufficient)

Any future realization proposal must satisfy **all**:

1. **Traceability** — One-to-one TRACE to Phase 4 artifacts  
2. **Authority Isolation** — No inherited or implied execution authority  
3. **Fail-Closed Semantics** — HALT on ambiguity or failure  
4. **Auditability** — Deterministic inputs and complete provenance

---

## 5. Governance Gates

No realization proposal may proceed without:
- Explicit user authorization
- Phase 5 governance closure
- Independent audit confirmation
- Explicit rollback and revocation constraints

---

## 6. Prohibition

This document does **not** authorize:
- execution
- implementation
- persistence
- runtime semantics

Any contrary interpretation is invalid.
