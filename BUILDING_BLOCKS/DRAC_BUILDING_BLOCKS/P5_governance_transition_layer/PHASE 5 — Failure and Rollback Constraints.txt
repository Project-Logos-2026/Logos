# PHASE_5_FAILURE_AND_ROLLBACK_CONSTRAINTS.md
Status: CANONICAL | DESIGN-ONLY | AUTHORITATIVE
Authority: NONE
Execution: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
Phase: Phase 5 — Substage 5.4
Scope: Failure constraint definition only

---

## Semantic Synopsis (GPT Handoff)

Enumerates failure classes and rollback constraints governing any future realization consideration.  
Defines constraints only; no recovery or execution logic.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **complete failure mode registry for Phase 5 scope** and the rollback constraints that govern any future, separately authorized realization.

---

## 2. Failure Mode Registry (Complete for Phase 5)

### 2.1 Governance Failures
- Implicit authority inference
- Boundary collapse (design ↔ execution)
- Phase reinterpretation or backfill

### 2.2 Semantic Failures
- TRACE violations
- Unauthorized DERIVE
- Shadow semantics introduction

### 2.3 Execution-Adjacent Failures
- Partial activation
- Non-determinism
- Persistence leakage

This registry is **complete for Phase 5**.

---

## 3. Extension Protocol (Future Phases Only)

- New failure modes may be added **only in later phases**
- No retroactive modification permitted
- Extensions require explicit authorization and audit

---

## 4. Rollback Constraints

Any future authorized state change must be:
- Fully reversible to a known safe baseline
- Logged with complete provenance
- Manual, explicit, and total

Explicit prohibitions:
- No automatic retries
- No self-healing
- No silent mutation

---

## 5. Halt Supremacy

HALT overrides:
- execution
- orchestration
- persistence
- optimization

HALT is immediate and non-recoverable without reauthorization.

---

## 6. Fail-Closed Rule

Any ambiguity or validation failure results in **STOP**, not revision.
