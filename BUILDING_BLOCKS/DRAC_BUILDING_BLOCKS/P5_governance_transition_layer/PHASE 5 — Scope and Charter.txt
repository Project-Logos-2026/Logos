# PHASE 5 — Scope and Charter
**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY  
**Authority:** NONE  
**Execution:** FORBIDDEN  
**Layer:** Governance / Orchestration  
**Invariants:** G1 (Deny-by-Default), G7 (Monotonic Authority)  

---

## 1. Purpose

Phase 5 exists to govern the **transition boundary** between:
- fully formal, design-only artifacts (Phases 1–4), and
- any potential future realization or execution.

Phase 5 does **not** authorize execution.
Phase 5 defines **how execution could ever be authorized**, if at all.

---

## 2. Phase 5 Scope (What This Phase Covers)

Phase 5 is responsible for:

1. Declaring **decision prerequisites** for realization.
2. Defining **governance gates** that must be passed before any execution.
3. Establishing **traceability rules** from Phase 4 artifacts to any future implementation.
4. Separating:
   - governance decisions,
   - implementation planning,
   - and executable realization into explicitly distinct tracks.

Phase 5 may produce:
- governance documents,
- roadmaps,
- grounding rules,
- authorization schemas,
- audit and validation frameworks.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Scope (What Phase 5 Does NOT Do)

Phase 5 does **not**:

- implement runtime logic
- generate executable code
- bind Coq proofs to runtime
- enable persistence
- authorize autonomy
- reinterpret or modify Phase 4 artifacts
- backfill missing semantics

All such actions remain **forbidden unless explicitly authorized in a later phase**.

---

## 4. Relationship to Phase 4 Artifacts

Phase 4 artifacts are:

- **Canonical**
- **Immutable**
- **Consumed, not extended**

Phase 5 artifacts may:
- reference Phase 4,
- trace to Phase 4,
- gate future use of Phase 4 artifacts,

but may **never reinterpret or revise them**.

---

## 5. Authority and Governance Posture

- Default posture: **DENY**
- Authority is:
  - explicit,
  - scoped,
  - monotonic,
  - non-inferable.

Any future execution authority must:
- be separately granted,
- pass explicit audit gates,
- and be revocable.

---

## 6. Success Criteria for Phase 5 Closure

Phase 5 is complete when:

- All realization pathways are explicitly defined and gated.
- No ambiguity remains about:
  - what may be implemented,
  - under what authority,
  - under which constraints.
- Governance documents are internally consistent and auditable.
- No execution authority has been implicitly introduced.

---

## 7. Closure Declaration

Phase 5 closure does **not** imply:
- readiness for execution,
- approval of realization,
- or transition to a runtime phase.

It implies **governance completeness only**.
