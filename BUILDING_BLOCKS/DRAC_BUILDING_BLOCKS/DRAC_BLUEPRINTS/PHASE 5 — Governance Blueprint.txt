# PHASE 5 — Governance Blueprint
**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY  
**Authority:** NONE  
**Execution:** FORBIDDEN  

---

## 1. Blueprint Objective

This blueprint defines the **structural layout** of Phase 5 as a governance transition phase.

It describes:
- tracks,
- artifacts,
- and decision boundaries,

without performing or authorizing any action.

---

## 2. Dual-Track Structure

Phase 5 is divided into two strictly separated tracks:

### Track A — Governance & Decision Track (Always Active)

Mandatory, design-only.

Includes:
- scope and charter,
- grounding rules,
- authorization schemas,
- audit gates,
- risk and boundary analysis.

This track **must be completed** before Track B may even be considered.

---

### Track B — Conditional Realization Track (Dormant by Default)

Inactive unless explicitly authorized.

Defines:
- *what would be implemented*,
- *how it would be gated*,
- *under what constraints*,

without implementing anything.

---

## 3. Gate Model

All transitions from Track A → Track B require:

1. Explicit user authorization.
2. Audit confirmation of Phase 5 governance completeness.
3. Explicit scoping of executable components.
4. Manual acceptance of risk and rollback constraints.

No automatic transition exists.

---

## 4. Blueprint Constraints

- No Track B artifact may exist without Track A completion.
- No Track B artifact may imply execution.
- No Track B artifact may claim authority by inheritance.

---

## 5. Blueprint Outcome

At completion, Phase 5 yields:

- a closed governance framework,
- a clearly delimited realization envelope,
- and a system that is **safe to remain non-executing indefinitely**.
