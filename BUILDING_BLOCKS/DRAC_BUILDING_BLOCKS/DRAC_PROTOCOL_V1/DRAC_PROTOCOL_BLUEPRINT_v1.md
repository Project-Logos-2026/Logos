DRAC PROTOCOL — AUTHORITATIVE BLUEPRINT v1
==========================================

Status
------
Design-authoritative. Non-executable. No legacy inheritance.

Role Definition
---------------
DRAC (Dynamic Reconstruction & Adaptive Compilation) is a non-agentic,
epistemic protocol responsible for deterministic reconstruction of Logos
runtime environments from first principles, and for governed, per-user
adaptive extension of application functions (AFs) and contextual embeddings
(CEs), without mutating canonical axioms or invariables.

Domain Placement
----------------
- Domain: Epistemic / Operations
- Agentic authority: NONE
- Reasoning scope: Epistemic only
- Write authority: Scoped, governed, non-core only

Core Responsibilities
---------------------
1. First-principles reconstruction of Logos runtime per user
2. Deterministic rebuild after corruption or failure
3. Real-time mediation of AF / CE availability for execution stack
4. Proposal (not approval) of new AFs and rare CEs
5. Enforcement of invariant compliance during all operations
6. Zero cross-user memory or state bleed

Explicit Non-Responsibilities
-----------------------------
- No semantic reasoning
- No truth adjudication
- No SMP or AA processing
- No axiom mutation
- No orchestration control
- No execution-side logic

Subsystems
----------
- Invariable Resolution Engine (IRE)
- Reconstruction Planner (RP)
- Deterministic Build Engine (DBE)
- Real-Time Capability Mediation Layer (RCML)
- Adaptive Extension Planner (AEP)
- Verification & Attestation Engine (VAE)

Lifecycle
---------
1. User Initialization:
   - Load invariables
   - Resolve constraints
   - Reconstruct Logos runtime from zero

2. Runtime Adaptation:
   - Receive capability gap requests via SOP
   - Supply AFs/CEs if available
   - Propose new AFs/CEs if gaps persist

3. Governance Gate:
   - All proposals routed to Logos Agent
   - SOP enforces approval boundary

4. Persistence:
   - User-scoped adaptations retained
   - Core remains immutable

Safety Guarantees
-----------------
- Deterministic builds
- Invariant enforcement
- Fail-closed behavior
- No unilateral mutation
