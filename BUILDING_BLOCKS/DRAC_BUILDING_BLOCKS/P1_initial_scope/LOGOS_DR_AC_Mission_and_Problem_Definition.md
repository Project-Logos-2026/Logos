# LOGOS DR–AC — Phase 1  
## Mission and Problem Definition

**Status:** Canonical  
**Phase:** Phase 1 — Concept Definition  
**Execution:** Forbidden  
**Scope:** Declarative Only

---

## 1. Mission Statement

The Dynamic Reconstruction / Adaptive Compilation (DR–AC) subsystem exists to safely reconstruct a usable working context for LOGOS from governed inputs, without semantic invention, authority escalation, or uncontrolled persistence.

Its purpose is not intelligence, creativity, or reasoning.

Its purpose is **structural reconstitution under constraint**.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Modern adaptive systems fail in one or more of the following ways:

- They conflate memory recall with semantic generation.
- They adapt without traceability.
- They persist artifacts without governance.
- They hallucinate structure when inputs are incomplete.
- They cannot safely resume work across sessions.

DR–AC exists to solve **this specific class of failure**.

---

## 3. What DR–AC Is

DR–AC is:

- A **governed reconstruction pipeline**
- A **non-semantic assembler**
- A **traceability-preserving compilation boundary**
- A **fail-closed system**

It reconstructs context; it does not reason about truth.

---

## 4. What DR–AC Is Not

DR–AC is not:

- A learning system
- A planner
- A reasoning engine
- A policy engine
- A memory system
- An agent
- An optimizer

Any capability beyond reconstruction and compilation is out of scope.

---

## 5. Success Criteria (Phase 1)

Phase 1 is successful if:

- The problem DR–AC solves is unambiguous.
- The mission is bounded and non-expansive.
- There is no implied autonomy or intelligence.
- Downstream phases cannot reinterpret DR–AC as adaptive cognition.

---

## 6. Phase Boundary

Phase 1 ends when:

- Scope is fixed.
- Non-goals are explicit.
- Responsibility is clearly partitioned from other LOGOS subsystems.

No design decisions occur in Phase 1.
